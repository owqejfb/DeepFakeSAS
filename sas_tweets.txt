Like @CP3 didn't have ENOUGH to deal with already!!!

Baseball has a damn modern day Babe Ruth on their hands and what are they doing about it???? @ESPNPlus

Amen!!!

RT @TishaESPN : In just one in a series of improbable events, Brian Mulhern spotted himself behind @stephenasmith after a Warriors game in 2019. Read why it became a pivotal moment in our latest #scfeature about Mulhern and @Athletics right fielder Stephen Piscotty #als

It‚Äôs 2 1/2 hours later, since we landed, and Newark International (EWR) still hasn‚Äôt gotten us to our gate to de-board.

What a disgraceful situation here at Newark Airport (EWR). How does a plan land, yet not only your plane ‚Äî but 3 planes in front of you ‚Äî have no gate to dock into so folks can get off the plane? Not to mention being 2-hours late. How does that happen?????

These NCAA changes may be too little, too late.

RT @ESPNPlus : Ben in the Bay?

Accusing Phill Jackson of being racist is one of the most ridiculous things Scottie Pippen has ever said or done.

The COWBOYS... AIN'T NO WAY! üòÇ

Yes, I did say it damnit! Because it‚Äôs true!

RT @espn : We see your hustle and value your work.

OMG Nooooooo!!!!! @Giannis_An34 lands awkwardly on knee and challenging alley-pop to @CapelaClint. He‚Äôs being helped off the court. It looks like an ACL.#PrayersUP

Ty Lue is the best coach in basketball right now. YEP!

Ain‚Äôt No Damn Way!

RT @RealMikeWilbon : I guess this isn't going away any time soon @stephenasmith! ü§£ (via @kevROSHAY)

Playoff P showed UP! Give credit where credit is due.

KAWHI GOING CRAZY!

Happy Birthday to @RealDealBeal23. Snd congrats on a great season. Wishing you many more in both categories, bro.

I still see Phoenix winning this game.

All I know right now is this: @MookMorris2 is putting on a show right now. He‚Äôs the MVP of this first quarter

It‚Äôs on tonight!!!!!!!

Expect more of this stuff TONIGHT on @SportsCenter w/ Stephen A at 7pm EST on ESPN. @RealMikeWilbon @KendrickPerkins üòé

Welcome to Stephen A's World on ESPN+!

Having said that about the @ATLHawks, it means absolutely nothing if @Khris22m continues to shoot like this. Mr. Roller Coaster himself is putting on an absolute show, gunning 3‚Äôs from all over the place. He is the MVP of this game!

Yes! I did say this earlier in the week about the @Hawks. And I still feel this way

SportsCenter hosted by YOURS truly coming on at 730 EST! Join me on ESPN, y'all.

It was absolutely lovely having @JaviciaLeslie on Stephen A‚Äôs World. She‚Äôs welcomed anytime

LET'S DO THAT HOCKEY @PKSubban1

I believe the Warriors are going to make a push to get Ben Simmons.

I'm not a fan of @KDTrey5's response to @ScottiePippen.

I already told you, Man! Who the hell is Kyrie Irving to you? Slava Medvedenko?

With all due respect my brother, that is ridiculous. D-Wade and Chris Bosh (Miami), Kyrie and Kevin Love (Cleveland) and Anthony Davis (Lakers). WTH is the matter with you? You know basketball. You‚Äôre a 6-time champion. How can you utter such Blasphemy?

SportsCenter with ya boy... Starting RIGHT NOW!

My reaction to Steve Kerr saying Kevin Durant is more gifted than Michael Jordan.

I was very sleepy today during @FirstTake

Haaaaaa! Love it.

DAMN, Alex Caruso!!!

Keep doing big things, my brother @DWade. Proud of ‚Äî and happy for ‚Äî you and the Misses @itsgabrielleu. As ALWAYS!

Join me on @espn's Twitter Space:

OH NO YOU DIDN'T!

SportsCenter with Stephen A... coming up at 7 EST. Come join!!

I received this text about Ben Simmons from somebody very close to the situation...

What else could @KDTrey5 have done???

Ben Simmons is not a championship point guard!

I said it this morning, and @MagicJohnson agrees: The Sixers need to trade Ben Simmons.

Devin Booker is the next Kobe Bryant.

Ben Simmons has GOT to go!

Nothing is more rewarding than fatherhood. PERIOD.

Juneteenth

My reaction to the Kemba Walker trade

Yup!

I'll say it again: Ben Simmons can't shoot, and as a result, that's why the 76ers AIN'T gonna win the title!

It's a DAMN mess in Dallas, and it's NOT because of the Cowboys!

Paul George stepped up tonight!

Join me tonight at  @Complex

As I was saying...

RT @ESPNPlus : .@prattprattpratt used to do what kind of commercials? üòÇ

This is the real reason the @Sixers lost the game last night. It ain‚Äôt that damn complicated!

The winner of the @WKCDOGS has some SWAG, but DAMMIT he seems a bit arrogant!

We are going to learn A LOT about the Sixers in Game 5.

RT @ESPNPlus : ‚ÄúNobody learned to shoot a basketball like that.‚Äù

The greatest player in the history of New York is @KDTrey5.

Ain‚Äôt No Way! I love this segment

"It's the fastest growing sport... Yet, we're still not being treated or have the same opportunities, amenities that others do."

You don't throw the MVP out of an elimination game! At least not for THAT!

Let‚Äôs be clear: @CP3 was the MVP of this series. One of the GREAT point guards to ever play this game. What a sensational performance. As for @DevinBooker31, @kobebryant‚Äôs watching from above, bro. He‚Äôs proud. You looked @kobebryant-esque the whole series. @Suns=Finals?#Hmmm

I‚Äôm turning the channel away from @NBAonTNT. No sense in even watching the rest of this game. You don‚Äôt EJECT the league-MVP on a play like that. That‚Äôs the league completely ignoring fan‚Äô interest. You just don‚Äôt do this. See y‚Äôall on @FirstTake and Stephen A‚Äôs World tomorrow.

This is the damn problem with the @NBA right now.. you do not make that call vs Jokic a FLAGRANT2. The swipe was a frustration foul. We‚Äôve seen worse. The fans do not attend games for this kind of call. You‚Äôve EJECTED the league-MVP. You don‚Äôt do this.#Unreal

Noooooooooo!!!!!!! Please, please, please be healthy, Kyrie Irving. He stepped on @Giannis_An34 foot and twisted his ankle. It looks bad. Prayer that he‚Äôs healthy. We need to see the show that man provides in these playoffs.

Like @dc_mma said, @stylebender is BOX OFFICE!

Donovan Mitchell is the best player in the history of the Jazz organization. That‚Äôs right! I said it!

Let‚Äôs do that soccer!!!

I‚Äôm telling you, I like @BruceBrown11, but I might be tempted to BENCH him fir the rest of the damn players. I‚Äôm on kidding ‚Äî just being emotional ‚Äî but how in the HELL do you NOT pass the ball to @KDTrey5 or give it back to Kyrie? How? How? How?

I don‚Äôt know why the hell @Bucks fans are celebrating????? There‚Äôs 11.4 seconds left after that last basket by @Jrue_Holiday11. There‚Äôs @KDTrey5 needing a basket ‚Äî not a three. Good luck!!!

As my man, @MarkJackson13 always says: ‚ÄúMomma, there goes that man‚Äù.....@KDTrey5. Simply the GREATEST scorer in the game today. Just lethal. Cannot be stopped tight now.

My reaction to @Dak Prescott‚Äôs request fir him and his @DallasCowboys:

RT @ESPNPlus : .@stephenasmith demands to see Giannis play with some ‚Äúpride‚Äù üò§

IT'S TIME TO STEP UP, GIANNIS!

On this day in Smithstory.... 2 years ago today on @FirstTake, this BLASPHEMY happened.

Proud of my boss. One of the best in the business.

Stop it, @CP3. Stop it! Don‚Äôt do the @nuggets like this anymore. You‚Äôve hurt them enough tonight with this performance. I know there‚Äôs still about8-minutes left, but damn!

RT @ESPNPlus : He has unfinished business with McGregor and Masvidal, but @NateDiaz209 tells @StephenASmith he's keeping his options open after #UFC263 üëÄ

Congrats to the @NBAonTNT crew for their two Emmy‚Äôs ‚Äîbut especially to the great @TurnerSportsEJ for his continued excellence. Keep setting the standard for us all, sir. Proud to know you!

I am excited to be joining my man @pat_croce on the next @AmericanCancer ACS HEALED virtual community gathering this Wednesday, June 9th at noon on Zoom!

Not tomorrow. But Game 5........if necessary.

Where the HELL has this @blakegriffin23 been???

If @CP3 wins a title...

GREAT to have @SHAQ on today's episode of Stephen A's World!

Oh, will y'all stop with that BS. You're just the type of dude that has everyone looking forward to competition, only to say when you lose: Well, I have generational wealth. I'm a champion. Doesn't have a damn thing to do with the price of tea in China. That's not the subject.

We'll see.

Watch the segment big-bro. Listen and learn. Because you know I'm coming in just a few minutes. #@FirstTake

The difference between @nyknicks' fans and @dallascowboys' fans is simple: Up until this year, we always knew we were trash and acknowledged as much. You guys continuously think you're worth something, despite being trash for a quarter-century.

That's because you're thinking strictly football. @AaronRodgers12 knows he'll likely be successful wherever he goes. He doesn't want to play for THEM...@packers mgmt. Period. It's personal. They haven't treated him well for years. That's the issue.

OMG! @CP3 has gone ballistic, and so have the @Suns. They e made 17 of their last 22 shots. They‚Äôve just exploded. And that environment with the fans is just bananas. This is really beautiful to watch. It‚Äôs special.

Losses happen come playoff time, obviously. We all know that. But when you‚Äôre getting your asses kicked ‚Äî like the @Bucks are right now, with @BrooklynNets emptying their bench with 9 min left, this is some inexcusable S&$@! Just embarrassing. So much for a decent series!

KAWHI deserves credit for stepping up. THIS is the Kawhi Leonard we were promised!

If the 76ers don't win Game 2, this series is over!

Today @QuavoStuntin told me he's playing in the @MLB Celebrity All-Star Game!

Can‚Äôt deny it. The @Clippers stepped up. Especially Kawhi. Gotta tip the cap to them.

I don't think the @FloydMayweather @LoganPaul fight was good for boxing.

Money! I get it! That‚Äôs why @FloydMayweather is doing this. And while we know @LoganPaul has no business in the ring with him at all, there is a 35-lb weight advantage that Paul has. Why is that even allowed? Ugh!

I‚Äôll be hosting my @SportsCenter NBA show at top of the hour (7pm EST). Don‚Äôt miss it!!!

LUKA!!!!!!

No need to corroborate! I said what I said. A well-connected league source simply texted me to say Karl-Anthony Towns would be a perfect fit with Dame in Portland. That‚Äôs all

It's OVER for the Lakers.

Ladies & Gentlemen....the @Lakers are down more points that they have 48-22 in the 2nd Quarter

Damn! @DevinBooker31 is destroying these boys. Watching this up close, they are literally toying with the @Lakers. Finally, Coach Fogel wants to double Booker. Too late. @Suns are flowing now. @Lakers body language awful. Don‚Äôt look like they have any flight left in them.

Told y‚Äôall. 6:35 left in the 1st Qt, @AntDavis23 is DONE. He‚Äôs limping back to the locker room now. He had no choice but to give it a try. But he‚Äôs Done! Now let‚Äôs see if the @Lakers are done

Damn! AD will not last this quarter for the @Lakers. Look at him. He can‚Äôt go. Get him out the game. He has nothing. He‚Äôs just too hurt.

For all of you who argue LEBRON is the GOAT, tonight is one of those games he NEEDS to win. @ESPNPlus

Here's why the Celtics situation bothers me so much.

The @Knicks season is over, Damnit!

LUKA is dominating. What's up, KAWHI???

I will applaud the @nyknicks tonight for the season they had ‚Äî before zeroing in on this team tomorrow morning. Congrats to @TheTraeYoung ‚Äî that young star ‚Äî Capela and the @ATLHawks. You were simply the better team, period. See y‚Äôall tomorrow on @FirstTake and @Stephen A‚Äôs World

Both are champions as a coach. When has Stevens been to the finals, let alone win a title? And where has Steve Nash coached.....EVER? STHU!!!

Thank you so much. It gets on my damn nerves when ppl act like I‚Äôm saying they got these opportunities because they‚Äôre white! That‚Äôs not my point. I‚Äôm saying Blacks NEVER get opportunities like that. It‚Äôs not fair.

That would make since if A.) They weren‚Äôt making 9 figure salaries and B.) If they didn‚Äôt snub their nose at those who hesitate to take stances because they DON‚ÄôT have 9-Figure salaries to fall back on!

Man, I WISH I could. I swear I wish I could

In fairness to @J30_RANDLE though, they‚Äôve already had 5-different guys guarding him. Coach Nate McMillan is throwing a fresh body at him all day and night!

Every time @J30_RANDLE does NOT hesitate, he makes his shot!

Here‚Äôs the deal: @J30_RANDLE is entirely too indecisive. He‚Äôs too tight. Not playing loose. Just spinner away from a double-team and made a turnaround jumper. @drose followed with a layup but looks to be laboring already, and it‚Äôs just the 1st Qt.#Damn!

I am already disgust. @J30_RANDLE‚Äôs first 2 shots was a fall away J and a contested 3. Attack the damn basket man. And stop shooting contested shots. Make quick decisions and stop letting the @ATLHawks defense get set. Come on, bro!

RT @FirstTake : "It's one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in all my life."

I only left for a minute. But I‚Äôm not about to lie. I‚Äôm pissed at these things happening ‚Äî only to see Black Athletes say nothing ‚Äî knowing these kind of opportunities don‚Äôt happen for us. So much for being WOKE.

I tried to tell Mr. @KendrickPerkins that the @Lakers would not win tonight. Even put a double-or-nothing scenario for him, thinking he wouldn‚Äôt dare take the bet. But he did. Then told me to carry-the-Hell-On. Well, he should know now. @Lakers blown out. You Perk?#CarryOn

Tis BROTHER.....@Dame_Lillard! DAME TIME! That is all that is necessary!!!!

You‚Äôre welcome my man. Respect to you and what you‚Äôre doing. But I hope you understand what I‚Äôm saying: you train with professionals. It‚Äôs not fair for you to fight non-boxers. But by all means, continue to make that money and promote/expose the sport of Boxing.

RT @ESPNPlus : D-Mitch? @stephenasmith could see it üëÄ

Just keeping it real. If this can help someone ‚Äî anyone ‚Äî that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre all here for.

At some point, you need to fight a real boxer, @JakePaul!

Naomi Osaka

Like I told @OmariHardwick, if the Nets don't get to the Finals, it will be BAD!

Major, Major, Major props to @KingJames, @mavcarter and everyone else associated the the documentary on ‚ÄúBlack Wall Street,‚Äù and the ‚ÄúTulsa Riots‚Äù that just aired on CNN. Absolutely outstanding job by the Brothers.#SALUTE

I'm not going to sugarcoat this, the Miami Heat are in VERY bad shape.

The LAKERS are in trouble!

Left groin strains for @AntDavis23. He will not return in Game 4. This is the reason I do NOT have the @Lakers as the favorite: Durability. It‚Äôs all about availability, people!!!

About damn time, sir! I recall asking where you were after you scored 7pts + was anemic offensively in Gm2. You ARE MUCH BETTER than that sir. Show it! Show up! Every damn game. Y‚Äôall have no chance unless you show up + you‚Äôve got the offensive skills to do it. So do it! #Respect

@IamTabithaBrown That is absolutely so, so beautiful. There aren‚Äôt enough words to say how beautiful it is

All I know is this: the @MiamiHEAT LOOK like they‚Äôre ready to go home. Basically, looks like they‚Äôre saying: ‚ÄúWhy The Hell Should we want to go back to Milwaukee!‚Äù

Really appreciated @RealMichelleW coming on Stephen A‚Äôs World today. She was truly inspirational.

At least fir right now, the @ Lakers are one lucky team!

I believe I told you @KendrickPerkins that the @sixers would win tonight‚Äôs game. And that I‚Äôve won the bet, too. As you would say sir......CARRY ON!!!!üòÄ

Gotta confess I‚Äôm sick to my stomach! The @nyknicks look SORRY right now ‚Äî and Julius Randle looks even worse. Not a single FG in the 1st half. Meanwhile, @TheTraeYoung is putting on a damn show. @nyknicks can‚Äôt shoot! It just looks bad right now.#LetUsPray

LUKA has been the BEST player in this damn series!

RT @ESPNPlus : Oh, hello! We made a Twitter just in time for #StreamingDay

There are 3 stars in this @Lakers/@warriors play-in game. But only 1 has shown it.....and he doesn‚Äôt play for the @Lakers. Got news for y‚Äôall: Steph is just getting warmed up

Combined this far, @KingJames and @AntDavis23 are 2-of-13. I‚Äôve gotta admit: I‚Äôm shocked by this. Totally shocked

Stunning part of this game this far ‚Äî with @warriors up 35-26 in the 2nd Quarter ‚Äî is that neither @KingJames nor @AntDavis23 have been a factor. Someone, despite their size & girth, they‚Äôve been neutralized

The @Lakers are 8-for -28 from the field. I expected better. Especially from @KingJames

I see a bunch of folks complaining about how @KingJames was at some party with Drake, so he shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to complain tonight. To that I only have one response: STHU and deal with it. You want him gone, BEAT HIM Damnit! Do t look for an easy out. Handle your damn business!

STHU! I talk about what I want to talk about.

Jayson Tatum put the world on notice!

I said what I said about the @Clippers and I meant it. Coach Ty Lue is entitled to his feelings; I‚Äôm entitled to mine

Still need y‚Äôall to GET @ ME for Stephen A‚Äôs World this week. Bring everything you got!!!!!

RT @ESPNRingside : .@StephenASmith believes @BronzeBomber should step aside and challenge the winner of Fury-Joshua instead of jumping right into a trilogy against @Tyson_Fury.

Sensational performances by Jason Tatum & Kemba Walker. @celtics vs @BrooklynNets in 1st. Who knows if @WashWizards will even make it, with injuries plus the way the @Pacers looked tonight.

See what I‚Äôm saying

That‚Äôs one way to look at it. Here‚Äôs the only: ppl close to him ‚Äî and soft-ass fans ‚Äî whine and Moab the second you say something critical about him. Folks caught up in their feelings instead of just discussing BBall. I‚Äôm not. I am GOING to talk BBALL. I don‚Äôt give a damn!

Y‚Äôall really have no idea how funny all of this is

Please bro. You clearly don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre talking to. That man is entitled to say whatever he wants. If/when I care enough to speak on it, I will. Pay attention and learn

No! No! Story was the folks in the league was saying he is

Folks! It‚Äôs called Big Boy rules the man has been minding his business fir years....taking one insult after another. He‚Äôs perfectly entitled to speak out. I have no problem with it. I can take it. Have at it.

Oh, STHU! I‚Äôm trashing them because I said they‚Äôre not a destination spot just yet? Grow the hell up, clown

I will do no such thing. I will not waste my time. That man is right; he‚Äôs been retired for years, yet all of us have been guilty of getting on him from time-to-time. He has every right to speak his mind. Go for it!

Are y‚Äôall really kidding me here. @KingJames is UNDERappreciated? In what works????

Appreciate you @MalcolmJamalWar  joining Stephen A's World today!

I‚Äôm so proud of my @Knicks. But are the truly a destination spot? Even I know that the answer right now is......Not Yet!

What the hell is going on @gordonhayward???

That was definitely a hack because I never once made that comment. I don‚Äôt get involved in stuff like that!

Yes we are. And I still stand by WTH I said

Yes sir. An absolute legend. Honored to have him as a colleague and friend.

See, this is the kind of nonsense that absolutely disgusts me @michaelirvin88, @nflnetwork. WTH have the @dallascowboys done to get OPENING NIGHT billing vs. the reigning defending champion @Buccaneers? What? What happened to actual MERIT? This is the problem with America today!

LET'S GO KNICKS!

So much for the HATE! The ATL gave @russwest44 mad love tonight with a well-deserved standing ovation for passing Oscar Robertson‚Äôs all-time Triple-double record. The @WashWizards still lost, but they were w/o @RealDealBeal23 and are still in playoff picture. All good this way!

He‚Äôs Baaaaaack! The return of the eternal optimist, himself.

CONGRATULATIONS to @Canelo. At this point there is simply no denying SAUL CANELO ALVAREZ is the best in the world. Period. There is no one we can look at from Junior Middleweight all the way to Light Heavyweight and say: ‚ÄòThey will beat Canelo!‚Äù NO ONE.#Pound4Pound#1inTheWORLD

Now THAT‚ÄôS wth I was asking for with @russwest44. Another triple-double, but COUPLED with the @WashWizards winning 12 of their last 15...AND being in the playoff pic. NOT celebrating stats when you‚Äôre 13 games UNDER .500. As my man @KendrickPerkins would say...CARRY ON!

*51 years ago today

50 years ago today, the @nyknicks won their first NBA Championship!!! Here‚Äôs the net from Game 7 with my man Spike Lee!

Kyrie!!!!

I see the momentum building with the @NHL! And I'm down with it!

Yes. I said it. I‚Äôm scared for the @Lakers.

Are you denying that @AaronRodgers12 has at least another four years in him.

Whatever!

Thanks for the kind words.

That's a fair question. @russwest44 is sensational. I think the point everyone's missed is that I'm saying he's soooo great, we've seen all of that. Now I want to see his talents battling for the title. That's all I'm saying. Nothing more.

True. But If I'm the @49ers, -- although I love Lance' potential -- I'd give him away for Aaron Rodgers in a heartbeat.

When I was 12, a drug dealer slapped me and changed my life.

RT @FirstTake : "Aaron Rodgers doesn't look good AT ALL. ... You cannot have stories leaking out that you want a GM fired and go into hiding and we can't find you. You cannot do that. That looks weak."

Can I dream when it comes to @AaronRodgers12. Can I dream, please

NAJEE HARRIS BABY!!!!

You COWBOYS fans are WORRIED, aren't ya????

I don‚Äôt have to make up my damn mind. When I got on Russ, it was simply me saying Triple-Doubles are not to be celebrated when you‚Äôre 13-games UNDER .500. Now that you see him winning games and vying for the playoffs, I haven‚Äôt said a damn word. #PrioritizeWinning!

And my Academy Award for Best Picture goes to......

And btw......props once again to ESPN‚Äôs Until UFC team. @Jon_Anik,@dc_mma, @joerogan, @MeganOlivi, @arielhelwani, @bokamotoESPN. We simply have the best team, period. Major props to my man @danawhite for this event, too. Packed house. First sport to do it.#Thanks2AllOfYou

Props to @GamebredFighter, though. That right hand alone should‚Äôve put him to sleep. But he wasn‚Äôt out until the 4th chop. And both he and @USMAN84kg showed incredibly class in their post-fight comments. Both are fantastic for the sport.

Oooohhhhh!!!! It‚Äôs over. @USMAN84kg by KO! Usman by KO. Usman by KO. Vicious right hand!!!! It‚Äôs over!!!!

Gotta give Round 1 to @USMAN84kg. Got him down plus connected on punches. But looks tired now

Damn! This is a hard one to pick: @USMAN84kg is a monster. But to me, so is @GamebredFighter.....who‚Äôs great for the sport. This can go either way. If it‚Äôs a KO, it‚Äôs Masvidal. Usman will not lose the decision.

Knicks.....9-Straight baby!!!!!!

Well deserved young brother. You‚Äôve earned the praise. Keep working on your game and getting better. You‚Äôve got ‚Äústar‚Äù written all over you bro. Make it happen.

The new NBA dunk KING = @MilesBridges! THAT'S RIGHT! I SAID IT!

I spoke to @GamebredFighter on Stephen A's World and he said @Benaskren "does NOT represent the sport of MMA."

Seeds are IRRELEVANT for the LAKERS!

Man he brings up a great point, but I CAN'T put @KyleKorver in my top 5 shooter list.

The KNICKS are actually GOOD!!!!

RT @TheUndefeated : Stephen A. isn't ready to celebrate after Derek Chauvin was found guilty on all counts for the death of George Floyd. (Via @firsttake)

I think this is the best @StephenCurry30 has ever looked in his career.

JUSTICE. You Damn Right!!!!!!!

I have a VERY important announcement.

"I feel like I'm unguardable."

My @SportsCenter NBA show is coming on at top of the hour! See y‚Äôall soon.

....But asked my opinion, I don‚Äôt believe it. And your comments, along with KD liking them, won‚Äôt change my opinion. Both of y‚Äôall have a wonderful day.

Actually, Josh, evidently YOU‚ÄôD like to believe you know what I think. But that‚Äôs neither here nor there. I respect the hell out of @KDTrey5 and he knows it. I just don‚Äôt believe for one second that he remembered SERGE IBAKA but forgot Westbrook. Could I be wrong? Of course....

I'm not impressed with @JakePaul's KO. But not because of him. It‚Äôs because of who showed up in the ring against him:

Get @ ME!

See, this has to stop. @jakepaul is not some scrub. He‚Äôs a pro now. Askren, even though he‚Äôs a @ufc fighter, is a grappler. Not a boxer. So why was he even in the damn ring? From now on, Paul needs to fight an actual boxer. He‚Äôs gonna hurt any non-boxer.

RT @espn : "You messed up Philly."

The greatest time I've ever had in the history of @FirstTake.

I swear.....I‚Äôm so sick of this S$$$! How many times are the fans gonna get screwed? Thank God for @KingJames! He‚Äôs the ONLY player who‚Äôs EARNED time off. Damn!

Yes! Athletes should start a Legal Defense fund

The Love Doctor is requesting your relationship questions.

The greatest shooter that God ever created.

Yes I do think @AROD is a great addition to an ownership group in ANY sports league.

Is there truly another point guard you‚Äôd rather have IN HISTORY than @StephenCurry30? I‚Äôm just asking. Isn‚Äôt it time we ask?

Oh God, No! @BeMore27 is down. Left knee. Could be hyperextended. Could be that he‚Äôs torn something. Prayers up that he‚Äôs okay. Please be okay. The game needs this guy. The @nuggets definitely need him. Praying he‚Äôs okay.

For the record, I just became aware of Kyrie‚Äôs situation ‚Äî which is his position. Today‚Äôs miss is one thing, but the other two times he was quoted as saying he ‚Äúneeded a break!‚Äù He played just 20 games last season and had 9 months off. Damn! Don‚Äôt we want to see the brotha play?

What the hell is going on with KYRIE?

The Honor was all mine, my brother. You were fantastic. It‚Äôs been great getting to know you. Continued success in the future. You know we will connect real soon.

RT @ESPNNFL : Will Sam Darnold turn his career around with the Panthers?

Hubert Davis being hired by UNC is not just another hiring. It's far more significant.

Blasphemy. And I love LaMelo. My rookie of the year. But come on!

I told @BaylorMBB coach Scott Drew I don't know if I've ever been more wrong.

Congrats to @BaylorMBB. Never thought I‚Äôd be this wrong. This was a beatdown. Wasn‚Äôt even close. Superior guard play. Men vs boys in the post. Attacked early & often. Never let up. Significantly the better team. Totally wrong on this.

I take it back. @BaylorMBB is dominating on both ends around the basket and their guards are destroying @ZagMBB. It‚Äôs still 12 minutes left but I think this is over. I only watched the Bears 2 or 3 times this year, but I never saw this coming. They are giving it to the Zags

Time is playing awful for @ZagMBB. But he‚Äôs got a chance to make up for it. Two of @BaylorMBB big boys are in foul trouble. He‚Äôs got to take advantage

Okay @ZagMBB. Okay. Showing some heart. Staying in this game. Pulling to within 10 at the half. But it means nothing if they don‚Äôt figure out a way to keep @BaylorMBB off the offensive boards. Don‚Äôt do that and the Bears won‚Äôt have a damn thing to worry about

This is some kinda ass-kicking @BaylorMBB is handing these boys. You can see how overwhelmed @ZagMBB is. Punched in the mouth and can‚Äôt stop the bleeding

Damn! The game is barely 5 min old and I already know I was wrong about @BaylorMBB. They are busting @ZagMBB you know what. This is unreal. Athletes & Dawgs. Taking it right to the Zags. This might be a damn blowout. Stay tuned!

The women's game is in a phenomenal place!

I‚Äôm all in on Gonzaga!

Utmost respect to Russell Westbrook, but last night‚Äôs numbers mean absolutely nothing to me.

Ahhhhhhh. You got me good @JeanieBuss, you got me good. There‚Äôs no excuse for me not having Jerry Maguire on the list. I humbly stand down to the Queen of the NBA.

On today's Stephen A's World, we have special guest @soledadobrien.

RT @ESPNNBA : The Nets are stacked.

@franfraschilla @UConnWBB That was a damn foul. Plain and simple. Horrible no-call

Forgive me for bragging, but we‚Äôve got the best @ufc coverage in the world on ESPN+. Ya got @dc_mma, @joerogan & @Jon_Anik cage side. @ChaelSonnen & @bisping providing color. My bro @michaeleaves Hosting post-fight coverage and @bokamotoESPN & @arielhelwani always on scene.üî•üî•üî•

To me, @JonnyBones is the greatest in the game. He‚Äôs a damn artist. But @francis_ngannou entered this fight at 264 lbs ‚Äî 29 lbs heavier than @stipemiocic, who‚Äôs a natural heavyweight. @JonnyBones is moving UP from light-heavyweight. Is that not a huge ask? I‚Äôm just asking!

And btw.......I can‚Äôt wait for @ufc 261 with Usman vs. Masvidal. That‚Äôs gonna be special.

Whoa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @francis_ngannou did it! @francis_ngannou! The NEW @ufc Heavyweight Champion of the world is also the SCARIEST champion. Absolute best thing in the world that could‚Äôve happened for the @ufc. Any event this man headlines will be BOX OFFICE. Must see!

Excellent, excellent analysis by @dc_mma abd @joerogan. Other defensive improvement by @francis_ngannou is evident, but his mouth was open

I got the goosebumps @jeremypiven. I got‚Äôem. This can go either way ‚Äî in the first damn round.

Okay. We all know @stipemiocic is the better boxer and all around talent ‚Äî WITH knockout power. But we all know what a monster @francis_ngannou is....with granite in both hands. Good Lord, anything can happen in this fight. Who y‚Äôall got???

Damn! @TWooodley came out aggressive, but got caught with the choke. Couldn‚Äôt get out of it. Luque got him. That‚Äôs now four-straight major losses in a row for Woodley. Damn! Wish that didn‚Äôt happen

Rooting for this man, @TWooodley. But he‚Äôs in real trouble right now

I‚Äôm not one of them, @bokamotoESPN. I love this kid, @SugaSeanMMA. He‚Äôs special. A finisher. He‚Äôs not joke, and he‚Äôs box office. The @ufc should love this kid, which I know it does.

Damn, Brooklyn Nets! Damn!!!!!!!!!!!

My NBA show - coming right up... Check out SportsCenter with Stephen A on ESPN... right NOW!

This brother, @Money23Green is one of the best defenders in the game. No doubt! But THE BEST? EVER? I can‚Äôt even give him that this year!

Lonzo Ball should be traded to the Clippers.

RT @NHL : With the NHL back on ESPN this fall, Commissioner Bettman caught up with @stephenasmith to discuss growing the game of hockey and more.

And to that I say.........SO WHAT! No one is saying Lonzo can‚Äôt play. I‚Äôve never question that. What I‚Äôve repeatedly question is his aggression. His ability to lead. Because that‚Äôs what true point guards need to do.

Always good to have my main man @MagicJohnson on @FirstTake. You know I‚Äôm looking forward to this. I‚Äôve got some questions for that man.

We all know the answer.....is THE ANSWER. We can admit that while acknowledging Kyrie is spectacular.

Better.....sure, skill-wise. Better handle. Better J. Hell, even a better scorer. But who‚Äôs more dependable? Who carried a franchise on his shoulders night-in + night-out? Who said, ‚ÄòGive it all to me‚Äô then basically carried his team to the Finals by his damn self?

Keep doing you, @CP3. I'm proud.

Wanna see Stephen A at the most embarrassing moment imaginable? Me on hockey skates. @NHL

It‚Äôs a sad state of affairs what this man has to deal with right now.

Watching this @okstate vs @BeaverMBB game. OK State has tremendous athletes and their traps are tenacious. But I‚Äôm watching one erratic play after another. Forced shots instead of hitting the open man is what is costing them this game. @BeaverMBB is just playing smarter.

The Love Doctor is here to answer all of your relationship questions.

I‚Äôm happy to host the parade if the Cowboys win the Super Bowl.

Don't go that far, Rick. @KingJames reservations are valid. I don't blame him, considering America's history with our community. I just think this is different. It's urgent, considering how we're being effected. And he should "consider" taking a public position. Nothing more.

RT @FrederickSwoop1 : Stephen A.  great commentary this morning on Covid 19 and referred reading of an article by Dennis Pullin!  I read the article the brother wrote and I shared it with my own brother and others with reservations about taking the vaccine! Thank you!

Why would it be a jab at me? Why can't @JalenRose just have a different opinion? I certainly respect it. Adults aren't offended by a different opinion. So what are you?

You don't know what the hell you're talking about and you certainly don't know me. I say what the hell I mean and mean what the hell I say. Period. I don't waste time with the kind of B.S. you just brought up.

Vernon, I would totally agree with you this normally. They only reason I disagree -- as I explained -- is because @KingJames himself has gone public on a lot of issues, declaring himself a leader, which he is. And how concerned he is about our community. This? Big Concern!

RT @MeBooRadley : @theprissypundit @stephenasmith @KingJames @espn @FirstTake @maxkellerman If LBJ doesn‚Äôt want to get the vaccine. Ok that‚Äôs his choice. He can look at history like the rest of us and make that choice. But seeing how this has disproportionately effected the AA community, I don‚Äôt think it would be wise to skip out. He just needs to reassess that decision

Amen.

Hell No I wouldn't have.

Amen.

Only the few petrified white folks would say that. We do at least 12 segments a day, and we're lucky if we touch on race twice a week. That's not about me. That's about you being too weak to embrace true, authentic conversation.

Thanks Bro.

Why? I don't feel like it.

Please. The @dallascowboys ain't winning a damn thing. I keep telling y'all a Black Cat is running around that franchise. Book it. They'll mess up on queue. Don't rush it. Wait for it.

I've very good. Just disgusted as folks not seeing the big picture. But I'm very good.

Bye! Go Get Him.

Thanks Bro.

It's not just about the money, bro. It's about the process. Anything could've happened to @dak over the last two years. Hell, something did happen to him (Ankle). Thank God he had some leverage. We shouldn't have to go through all of that to get what we've EARNED. Dak EARNED this

I could give a flying F&*^ what you believe. Watch the show and STHU. Or don't watch it. I won't miss you.

Man, I‚Äôm so sick of this little best, I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself :-)

Save your @blakegriffin23 slander. He can help the Nets!

I applaud the @NBA for pulling off All-Star Weekend!

Was an honor and privilege to have @JeanieBuss join @FirstTake today. #InternationalWomensDay

Respect to @funkmasterMMA for acknowledging he didn‚Äôt want to win this way. It was clearly an illegal kick and not his fault. However, it appears it wasn‚Äôt Yan‚Äôs fault either. Turns out his corner told him to kick, which means he got bad advice.

Yo y‚Äôall, @funkmasterMMA just won this fight by DQ. Completely legit that Yan should be disqualified. But here‚Äôs the question: should you LOSE the title on a DQ? That was an illegal knee. Got no problem with DQ. But to become a champion this way? Just reeks of illegitimacy.

This guy Yan just knows how to fight. Knows when to conserve his energy. Sterling looks like he‚Äôs about to go just due to fatigue alone.

Okay. This kid Sterling in @UFC259Card looks like he already punched himself out he‚Äôs clearly stronger than the champion. But Yan can throw punches and has speed. And he‚Äôs very patient. He‚Äôs not the one fighting with nervous energy.

I‚Äôve been on the peloton and treadmill but when @GuyFieri sends me food, I‚Äôm trying it!

If @PatrickMahomes watches basketball, I know where the hell he got it from: @StephenCurry30.

OH LORD!!

The Love Doctor needs all of your Valentine's Day questions!!!

I see you Baby Stephen A! I see you.

SportsCenter with Stephen A starts at 7pm EST, where I interview @luka7doncic.. The man said he's not playing very well. HAAA!

Thanks to @TomBrady, I‚Äôll never again have to debate the greatest QB of all-time.

Richard Sherman on Stephen A's World said he wants to play 2 more years and then "shut it down."

All that Patrick Mahomes GOAT talk is over.

Get @ Me! Send me all the questions you GOT and I will pick some to answer on Stephen A's World.

It‚Äôs OVER, everyone. @Chiefs defense couldn‚Äôt stop anything @TomBrady threw at them. And @Buccaneers defense was ELITE. No more talk about  MaHomes being the GOAT. He‚Äôs getting BLOWN OUT in the Super Bowl. Receivers can‚Äôt get open; he can‚Äôt throw them open. It‚Äôs over!

This looks OVER!!!!

Ladies & Gentlemen, this is not just the @Buccaneers winning. This is an ass-whooping! The @Chiefs are getting beaten up. And @PatrickMahomes literally looks helpless on the bench. The @Chiefs are getting BLOWN OUT right now! Damn!!!!

And let me make sure to say this while I can: Props to both the off. Coor (Byron Leftwich) and Def. Coor. (Todd Bowles for the @Buccaneers ‚Äî both African-Americans. They‚Äôve both called a great game thus far!

Just received a message from a former @Patriots: ‚ÄúTyrann Matthieu made the wrong move. He poked the bear that is @TomBrady. Brady is targeting him now. Going right after him.‚Äù Damn! This is something to see. @Chiefs are in a world of trouble. And btw....where is @PatrickMahomes?

Offsides by the @Chiefs on a FG attempt????? WTF! Are they just trying to give the damn game away???

WTH!!!!! This rookie punter @Townsend looks too damn scared to be out there. What in the hell are you doing, shanking a punt that badly???

Wow! Never saw @tkelce drop a pass this postseason. Nothing seems right about the @Chiefs right now. Gotta give my man @Realrclark25 credit too. He said the TB that could be the MVP of this game would be Todd Bowles. This @Buccaneers defense has been legit thus far.

Hold on a second. That was a stop right there. No TD!!!!!

Kansas City, we have a problem. First @RobGronkowski & AB. Now, @MikeEvans13_ has gotten lose, plus Jones and Fournette are running. @Buccaneers are doing what they want right now.#UhOH

You called it my man @JoeFortenbaugh. You called it right in Stephen A‚Äôs World on @ESPN+. You said @RobGronkowski would score the first TD of the game. You got me!!!

If Tom Brady pulls this off, I don't how you can argue he's not the best team sports champion in modern history.

It was a privilege to have the one and only @WendyWilliams join Stephen A's World.

DON'T MISS the Super Bowl because of the RONA! Stay in ISOLATION.

If Patrick Mahomes loses to Tom Brady in the Super Bowl, Mahomes will NEVER be able to surpass Brady as the GOAT.

The last time I saw Kobe Bryant, it was the happiest I had ever seen him.

RT @FirstTake : "Tom Brady proved that he deserved far more respect, adulation and deference from Bill Belichick than he received. And gratitude. Because he disguised Bill Belichick's deficiency as a GM."

A fan asked me who my greatest influence is and here's what I said.

I'm SICK of getting lectured by a BABY.

Give me Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, I tell you that Deshaun Watson could be equal to Patrick Mahomes.

I‚Äôll come on anytime you want me to, @LauraRutledge. It would be my honor to bless @ESPNNFL with my presence. But you and I both know @mspears96 and @danorlovsky7 are scared to death of me invading their territory. I don‚Äôt want to scare them like that. They Know! They know!üòÄ

Uh Huh! Uh Huh! Careful what y‚Äôall say @mspears96 & @danorlovsky7. I‚Äôm watching both of y‚Äôall on @ESPNNFL right now. I‚Äôm watching! I‚Äôm watching. And make sure you speak about @AaronRodgers12 RESPECTFULLY!!!!. Btw...Hi @AdamSchefter, @minakimes and -my favorite ‚Äî  @LauraRutledge

Get @ ME!!! I need all of your DAMN questions, concerns and issues with me that I will include as part of Stephen A's World.

How do you NOT go for it with RODGERS?????

As if drafting Jordan Love wasn‚Äôt bad enough, you just told @AaronRodgers12 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust you.‚Äù If I‚Äôm Rodgers, I couldn‚Äôt even look at him. LaFleur is now that that Off. Coordinator with the 27th-ranked offense who didn‚Äôt deserve this job. I don‚Äôt care right now.#Shameful

Props to @TomBrady. He is the G.O.A.T. Just too special to put into words right now. But how Matt LeFleur could not go for it on 4th & Goal with @AaronRodgers12 as his WB is just insulting beyond words. I don‚Äôt give a damn about the 2 trips to NFC Title game. I don‚Äôt care!

What the hell is La Fleur doing? How do the @packers not go fir a 4th-&-Goal with 2:05 left, down 31-23, and @AaronRodgers12 is your Quarterback? How? How? How, Damnit!!!!

That interception right there was not on @TomBrady. That was on Leonard Fournette. You‚Äôve got to pick up the blitz on that, to make sure Brady has time to throw. He didn‚Äôt have any

Jesus! St. Brown. How can you drop that2-pt conversion, man? How could you. You‚Äôre a professional. This is the NFC-Title Game.#Damnit!

Hold on now! Hold on now! I don‚Äôt hear Fat Lady

That‚Äôs the 2nd time @AaronRodgers12 missed a wide-open Lazard, looking fir Adam‚Äôs. Come on A-Rodg. That‚Äôs 14 points, bro

Damn! Damn! Damn! I should not have jumped off the @Buccaneers bandwagon. Can‚Äôt defend. Can‚Äôt hold onto the damn ball. What the hell was I thinking?

The one thing that‚Äôs hard for me to stomach is flagrant stupidity. There are 8 seconds left. How in God‚Äôs name does this dude Kevin King - No.20 on the @packers y‚Äôall ‚Äî allow Scotty Miller to get BEHIND him. I mean...how DUMB can you be????

It's that time again, y'all. Ask me any question you want over video on your mind in regards to sports. I will pick some to answer on Stephen A's World on ESPN+.

The best player in the NFL right now.... @AaronRodgers12.

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith blames Lamar Jackson for Ravens‚Äô loss.

The @BrooklynNets are going to the FINALS, with or without Kyrie Irving

Now that is how you catch a pass, Chris Godwin. The way a ROOKIE in Tyler Johnson just caught that 15-Yard catch for a first down. Come on Godwin! The @Buccaneers will need you bro. They will need you. Be ready

See. That‚Äôs that BS right there with Chris Godwin. You have GOT to catch that damn ball. You just have to do that. I‚Äôd think very seriously about continuing to throw him the football. How many passes has he dropped in these two playoff games?????

It‚Äôs officially scary now. The champs ‚Äî the @Chiefs ‚Äî no longer have @PatrickMahomes, who‚Äôs officially out with a concussion. And the @Browns are running the football. It‚Äôs 22-17 now.......without @PatrickMahomes. That would qualify as an ‚ÄúUh-Oh.‚Äù

Holy S$&@! @PatrickMahomes is concussed. He‚Äôs heading to the locker room. The @Chiefs could be in some real trouble here. Looks like @bakermayfield & the @Browns may get the chance they are looking for! Stay Tuned

Great drive by the @Browns. Basically gave the damn ball to Chubb & Hunt, which is what they should do. But why in the helm did they kick the extra point instead of going for 2-pt conversion? Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me

Feel bad for @bakermayfield. He‚Äôs playing well, and then Higgins loses the ball near a TD for a touchback. It‚Äôs an unfair rule. The offense should maintain possession, but it is what it is. And hey @Browns, how about giving Kareem Hunt a few touches. That would be nice.

@BuffaloBills Ummmm, Hello @BuffaloBills. Despite my reservations, if you viewed @FirstTake on Friday you would see that I actually picked y‚Äôall to win the game and advance to the AFC Championship. If you‚Äôre gonna tell the story, tell the whole story please. Thank Ya!

Haaaa. Love it. The @Saints got me good. That‚Äôs what happens when you talk too damn fast. I addressed my mistake on my new show: ‚ÄúStephen A‚Äôs World‚Äù on ESPN+. But they got me. Haaaaaa!!!!

If you really think that you‚Äôre completely misinformed. You think the @BrooklynNets don‚Äôt consider this a big deal? Why the hell you think they finally made the deal for @JHarden13? And why did the @NBA fine him? Wake up!

STHU! I‚Äôve spent years giving @KyrieIrving nothing but love. And I‚Äôll still give it to him. But you‚Äôve got to show up to work. You can‚Äôt just disappear. That‚Äôs just not responsible. No injuries, plus socializing & being on social media. Then you should be able to call. Be quiet.

Actually, it‚Äôs not. We‚Äôre not an MMA show. We were helping to promote the UFC.....so ppl like yourself who may really know it can see your sport get a higher profile. So calm the hell down. We never claimed to be experts at that.

Just doing my thang :-)

No Sir! I‚Äôll just be wrong. We‚Äôre talking sports and having fun with it, that‚Äôs all. If I‚Äôm wrong, it won‚Äôt be the first or last time regarding a prediction. But at least I told you how I honestly feel. It‚Äôs not a crime. It‚Äôs all in fun, bro.

Clearly Kyrie Irving doesn‚Äôt want to play basketball bad enough.

I think Kyrie Irving should announce his retirement today.

I‚Äôve seen enough. See y‚Äôall on @FirstTake at 10am in the morning.

Can‚Äôt wait for my man @SnoopDogg to join me tomorrow on Stephen A‚Äôs World on ESPN+.

Very happy for @Lj_era8. He handled his business. But the story of this game was that @Ravens Defense. They shut down Henry and rendered @ryantannehill1 non-existent. That defense is fir real, and they showed us why today.

OH, and you can send your questions over video too!!

Y‚ÄôALL, I‚Äôm starting a new segment on my ESPN+ show where I answer fan questions. Please send over all of your questions using #StephenAsWorld!!!!

Just woke up and watched the Re-Air of @hornets win over @ATLHawks. Let me tell y‚Äôall something: @MELOD1P looks REAL. As in real special. Loves playing. He‚Äôs assertive. Aggressive. Look out. He‚Äôs finishing games already. He‚Äôll probably be starting in a week.

Happily Belated Birthday bro. Wishing you many more. See you soon

Oh my damn! I just saw @RealDealBeal23 say this about his @WashWizards team defense: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt guard a parked car!!!!‚Äù OH MY DAMN!!!!

Good Lord! What an explosion by the @warriors. This brother @StephenCurry30 is just special. The Greatest Shooter on the planet earth. Meanwhile, Kawhi & the @LAClippers have no answer. Put their heads down when adversity arrived. I don‚Äôt know if I believe anymore.

It makes me very, very proud to be somebody that's been associated with the NBA.

Well, well, well. I reckon those COWBOYS have just been eliminated from the playoffs üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

TO all the COWBOYS fans!

Okay @RjBarrett6. Okay @AustinRivers25. Okay @nyknicks. I‚Äôm watching! I see y‚Äôall. I see y‚Äôall. Playing hard EVERY night. And getting better, too. I‚Äôm watching! I‚Äôm watching! Way To Go!

This is straight B.S. for the second straight year in the playoffs this kid from @ClemsonFB named Skalski is ejected for ‚ÄúTargeting.‚Äù What is the guy suppose to do? Stand straight up and tackle? I mean, come on! What B.S. I feel so bad for that kid. Why even play defense.#Damn!

Ooohhh, @mspears96 you have crossed the line. Your damn BLASPHEMY will not be tolerated on @FirstTake this morning. It will not be tolerated. Oooh, I‚Äôm gonna get you. You‚Äôre trying to steal MY A-LIST with all those ‚ÄúDamns‚Äù spewing out of your mouth. I WILL deal with you soon!

Let me be clear ‚Äî especially to the @FirstTake crew and that damn @mspears96. Just because I‚Äôm on vacation doesn‚Äôt mean that folks get to ignore my A-List today. And I know one thing: I had better not hear that boring question ‚ÄúThank You For Asking.‚Äù I‚Äôll be watching SWAGU

And still get released inside of two years? This has bad attitude written all over it. Not being mature enough. Not working hard enough. Why else would @WashingtonNFL let him go right now? Inside of 2 years, Haskins entire football career is now officially in grave jeopardy.

Even on vacation I need to step out and say this: I was totally WRONG about Dwayne Haskins. Thinking the @Giants were foolish to pass up on him in favor of Daniel Jones, I look like a damn fool. You know how bad you have to be as a player ‚Äî and person ‚Äî to be a 1st-round pick...

Good lord have mercy. I‚Äôve seen blowouts before but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever witness a team being down by 50 ‚Äî like the @LAClippers trailed the @dallasmavs. JESUS! Even without Kawhi, there‚Äôs no excuse. I mean......Damn!

Okay @steelers. Thank God fir that comeback. Wait to handle your business. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

@jerryjeudy @TeamJuJu Yes @jerryjeudy....Yes. Take this lesson from an older head bro ‚Äî who‚Äôs rooting for all of y‚Äôall. Damn right it‚Äôs a problem when your losing. Dance, sing, do what the hell you want when you win. But when you lose, every damn things a problem. Shoes, dancing, hairdo, etc.#Life

Okay @TeamJuJu. Okay. I see you bro. THAT...is what the hell we have been waiting for. That is the talent we know you to have. Now go help the @steelers close this game out and you can dance on @tiktok_us at Midfield all you want to damnit. Let‚Äôs do this.

Damn! Sitting here watching @HoustonRockets vs @trailblazers game expecting @JHarden13 and @Dame_Lillard to put on a show ‚Äî and @CJMcCollum is the one scorching everyone. The brother has 41pts.....and counting. I see you CJ. I see you!

I joined this young man Jake‚Äôs podcast today. He‚Äôs only 11 and y‚Äôall can check it out here on his YouTube.

@SportsCenter JESUS!!!!!!

This brother @TheTraeYoung is balling for the @ATLHawks right now. Closing the way a star is suppose to close. He‚Äôs still doing his thing. He‚Äôs got 34pts right now. He keeps playing like this and @ATLHawks keep improving, we can‚Äôt just talk about @luka7doncic anymore.

Of course I want @TomBrady and the @Buccaneers to win, but damn! These @Lions are a disgrace. Clearly, they didn‚Äôt come to play at all. Matt Stafford‚Äôs career has wasted away being with these guys ‚Äî even though he‚Äôs not playing today. What a nightmare!

RT @ARBernard : From my wife Karen and I and our congregation Christian Cultural Center, a very Merry Christmas & blessed New Year!

I don't think the NETS need to worry about the CELTICS

Here‚Äôs another one

I didn't have a Christmas outfit for today, but I did have THIS, which always brightens my day ü§†

In the end, that reality is what makes anything he does right now a story. Houston......you have a problem. He wants out!

If that‚Äôs what James Harden says, we should believe him. The brother deserves the benefit of the doubt; he always shows up. None of that load management stuff. But let‚Äôs also be clear about this: he will be a distraction for the Rockets because he wants OUT!

I'm calling for the basketball authorities to arrest @MaxKellerman IMMEDIATELY!

The NBA Season has officially begun

Time and time again, the expectations never fail @KingJames. They ELEVATE him.

Good Lord. I‚Äôve been complaining about my @steelers for weeks. But when it comes to Big Ben, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen him look this bad. Good gawd he looks awful in this first half.

Then say something right

yes. I am

Just gave it to you, bro.

Then you're mother must be a very passionate, articulate, intelligent, wonderful person :-)

Love ya back. Thank you.

Thank You.

Yep

Sure. No problem. But since he'd be violating his contract, pay up with the fines and we have no argument.

Damn skippy

Appreciate the effort, my brother. But you need to take some notes from Shiggy on Instagram :-)

Correct

I never knew a thing about the Covid-hoax lunacy.

Not so much that, bro. He can do what he wants. But it's a part of his contract. So like I said: I'll fine him every damn day.

Didn't work. I spit facts, bro. Especially in this sequence.

That ain't bad, bro. @RealDealBeal23 is something special. He's a baller, period. I don't give a damn what anyone says.

I don't care whether he talks or not, personally. What I will tell you is that: if you or I made that call, we'd be fined every day because it's a part of our contract. Period.

Damn Right! Thanks Bro.

Great seeing my man @ChrisCanty99 on @GetUpESPN right now. One of the best NFL analyst around. Love seeing you bro.

NOPE I'm not apologizing to BAKER yet.

I did correct myself on the air :-)

The @Browns have my respect.

Read previous tweet.

I know. I know. Just like everyone calls me a hater for saying @KingJames is the 2nd-best player on ALL-TIME. I mean, stop the damn presses. What a colossal insult.

THANK YOU SIR.

Not at all. Gave him his due credit......YESTERDAY.

I did give him credit. I said @bakermayfield performance was sensational.

Haaaaaaaaaaaaa

Then what would that make YOU.......since you're expending energy talking about me? CLOWN!

I hear your point.

Thanks Bro.

It's all love, bro. You're not suppose to agree with me. This is a debate show.

If you say so. I've seen enough playoff appearances and early exits. To me, this entire season is about whether they can beat the @Chiefs. They'd better not lose to anybody else. Bump that!

Actually, we're going to save it for tomorrow when we have more time to discuss.

We're about to in the next few minutes.

Stick with him. Save Wentz for next season. You can't get rid of him when he's a $59-mil dead hit. So get him right and save him next season. Let @JalenHurts continue to grow. I was impressed with him yesterday.

When I have time.......yes I actually do.

Haaaaaaa! Never saw this. Love this quote. Because it's true. At least for the strong

Oh Well!

You might be able to get over it if you'd done your damn homework. I generate revenue clown. I bring money to help KEEP JOBS, not lose them. Know who the F&^%$ you're talking about before opening your mouth. If you didn't know you should've asked somebody.

Amen. Y'all all know how I've felt about Adam Gase from Day 1.

Philadelphia owes @donovanjmcnabb an apology, along with some newfound respect and adulation. He was never close to being as bad as @cj_wentz looks right now -- even though I'm not giving up on Wentz. If this were McNabb, he wouldn't be allowed to walk the streets of Philly.

We agree there, bro.

Amen brother.

Because I wasn't focusing on that game. I was simply pointing out that was his last loss before this 4-game winning streak.

So you think it's JUST WENTZ......and not the Eagles' organization, too?

Typical drivel from someone who clearly isn't paying attention. I don't talk bad about the @Browns at all. I respect them and what they've done. I also respect @bakermayfield. I've simply pointed out he doesn't look like THAT DUDE yet & that we'll see. Nothing more. Pay attention

@TheVFoundation

OMG! Just when I was about to crucify Derek Carr fir just not being that guy, this dude for the horrible @nyjets, CB Lamar Jackson stupidly plants his feet and let‚Äôs Ruggs run right by him for a 46-yd TD with :05 sec left. The @nyjets are just Pathetic. Just horrible.

Okay y‚Äôall. @bakermayfield is balling right now. 3 TD‚Äôs and 186 yards passing and it‚Äôs still the first half. He‚Äôs doing it right now. Gotta give credit where it‚Äôs due

RT @geoffkeighley : It's about to be that time. #TheGameAwards welcome @stephenasmith as a presenter next Thursday night.

There's no quarterback who has done LESS with MORE than @BakerMayfield. I still respect him, but he‚Äôs got to do more if the @Browns are going anywhere.

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith urges Giannis to sign the supermax with Milwaukee.

I think the @Lakers have a chance to three-peat.

Oooooooh @Realrclark25 . So NOW you get my point about the @steelers. How many times have I said exactly what you just said on @GetUpESPN, only to listen to you throw shade my way? Ooooohhhhhh! I can‚Äôt wait to see you.#Blasphemous!!!!

AD is one of the top 3 players on the planet, but it's LEBRON! Everything about the @Lakers is about LeBron James.

Unreal! After all this talking Max did about Kawhi ALL LAST SEASON, look at this B.S. #Haaaaaaa

How does Spotify ALWAYS know?

HELL NO!

@TaeAndSyd @TheVFoundation Thank You Taelor & Sydni. So wonderful to hear from you both......knowing you‚Äôre making your Dad so proud as he watches you both from above. He is definitely missed every single day

If anyone has to go it‚Äôs Doug Pederson, NOT Carson Wentz!

Big announcement, FOLKS! The @hbcuweek Foundation is launching a special partnership that will offer 150 $40,000 scholarships to students who commit to an #HBCU and declare a STEM major. The application opens on 12/4! Visit  to apply.

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith literally took out his ear piece to avoid hearing Max's take on Tom Brady üòÇüò≠üòÇ

A very important day for an incredibly important cause @TheVFoundation

This is true. This is what happened

The best wide receiver in football is @cheetah!

Nate Robinson getting knocked out overshadowed the Mike Tyson fight!

Are y‚Äôall listening to my man @SnoopDogg call this fight. I don‚Äôt know about the rest of y‚Äôall, but I‚Äôm loving this. Snoop‚Äôs the most entertaining part of this fight. He‚Äôs doing fantastic.

Hey. RJ didn‚Äôt look that bad. Tyson has the better build and RJ doesn‚Äôt need to take any shots, but if he takes Tyson past 3, Tyson may fall out from exhaustion.

I‚Äôm praying for RJ! Very worried. This is Mike Tyson. I know RJ is the better boxer. But can he avoid getting hit. This is why I‚Äôm petrified for Roy. Hope I‚Äôm wrong

Damn! So sad to see my man Nate Robinson get KNOCKED OUT by @jakepaul like that. He never recovered from the 1st knock down. But to see him fall FACE FIRST......Damn y‚Äôall. Damn!

Go ‚ÄòHead @RealMikeRob. Let‚Äôem know what you feel. We watching! We watching! Keep up the great work Big Dawg!

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith calls for the Lions to fire Matt Patricia.

Ravens-Steelers should be postponed again.

HOWDY!

Thanksgiving this year is just.... LOVELY!!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£

Oh don‚Äôt y‚Äôall worry about looking for me on these @dallascowboys. I‚Äôll be back in a few short minutes, ya hear!üòÄüòÄüòÄ

All the best to you buddy @wingoz, the ultimate pro. You were always good to me. You‚Äôve always been thorough. And I‚Äôm sure whatever the future holds for you, you‚Äôll be great. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all.

There‚Äôs a lot of problems with these boys!

UGH @ESPNGreeny had to bring this up...

RT @GetUpESPN : .@stephenasmith wants people to start holding Bruce Arians accountable.

Sincere Congratulations. These guys represent the first All-African-American officiating crew in the history of the National Football League. Let‚Äôs remember their names. Their contribution!

@SportsCenter Do not waste y‚Äôall damn time asking me! Y‚Äôall know exactly what the hell I‚Äôll say

You think I‚Äôm joking, but I assure you I am not when it comes to this:

I DON‚ÄôT GIVE A DAMN, COWBOYS FANS!!!!!!!

Y‚Äôall say what the hell y‚Äôall want. But I‚Äôve said it many times and I‚Äôm gonna keep saying it. @AaronRodgers12 is a bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddddd Man! Made the near impossible look east. OT Baby! #WOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!

I‚Äôm done with Wentz, @maxkellerman. You got it. After two great throws, this guy holds onto the damn ball, misses a WIDE-OPEN Reagor, gets popped, and commits a pick-6. You can‚Äôt make this up. Unreal that he makes that kind of mistake with the way this season is going.

I don‚Äôt know what the rest of y‚Äôall are seeing, but I‚Äôll tell you this much: this kid FryFoggle from @IndianaFootball is putting on a damn show vs THE @OhioStateFB. The man has 224-yards receiving on 7 receptions. He‚Äôs made this a game

He‚Äôs 30

Delays on the Satellite. Best to be quiet at times

That‚Äôs about a week or two away buddy

False

I‚Äôm damn-sure a LA fan.....as in the city :-)

Haaaaa. Let‚Äôs do it

This.....from the man who knows so little.

Not my point. The point is: he‚Äôs 30. He hasn‚Äôt been throwing the football that much. So for him to beat out a 5-Year starter makes Jameis look very bad

No. You misunderstood. What I said is: they‚Äôre 32, not 38. So what do you mean you don‚Äôt want to mortgage the future? They ARE the future. Go for it

KAWHI, you OWE the @Clippers!

RT @FirstTake : NOT. OVER. YET.

Look, we gotta keep it real, y‚Äôall. We just gotta keep it real!

Devastated about this Klay Thompson news.

What is this dude @RealJayWilliams TALKING about? Haaaaaa

I like Obi Toppin a lot. I really really do. He‚Äôs from NY. He‚Äôs gonna rep the city. I have no doubt. But the Knicks needed a guard!

Ok! Here we go @nyknicks. Here we go. What‚Äôs Up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

All I‚Äôm waiting fir is to see what my @nyknicks are going to do with this damn 8th Pick. I‚Äôm waiting damnit! I‚Äôm waiting! Might even send a video

Okay. Very happy for LeMelo Ball. But Pops in Charlotte with Michael Jordan will be very interesting

Right pick by the @Timberwolves . Now the @warriors need to grab Wiseman

You look at a Super Hero that looks like one of us, and you feel like you could be a Super Hero. In the not too distant past, we didn‚Äôt think roles like this would happen! #ad #BeGreater #BeYourself

I'm STILL available, KNICKS! This could be the way to save things. (üìπ @Shady00018)

If the Nets get James Harden, they NEED to win a championship.

This could be it for Drew Brees.

You cannot lose the Greek Freak for nothing!

Hell YEAH the Lakers should be worried. About the Warriors, Nets AND Bucks.

If y‚Äôall DON‚ÄôT know who Miles Morales is, I‚Äôm here to EDUCATE you! #ad #BeGreater #BeYourself

Jacobi AND Meyers? :-)

Stay Tuned :-)

I‚Äôll still forget :-)

Amen

Ummm, FYI idiot: they are reporters on the scene. I‚Äôve graduated from that years ago. And still, I break several stories a year in my damn sleep. Do your homework. But Spears & Haynes are my boys. Future stars in the game. Love & respect to both. They know what you do not.

Up to @KDTrey5 to figure that out

No! I said Tom Brady and the cliff.

Yep

I didn‚Äôt comment on Cam. Just the team‚Äôs situation at this moment

Ain‚Äôt that the truth

RT @FirstTake : Drew Brees is STILL an elite NFL QB. @stephenasmith

Allen Iverson

Russell Westbrook and James Harden don't want to play with each other anymore.

I'm not running from that. I'd just want it to be unedited.

Both. They wanted Ty Lue but signed off on Silas once they were told he'd be the guy. Why is that so difficult to comprehend?

Good Point.

Happens all the time in the world of big business, bro. All the time.

Well then you heard me loud and clear

Resume, fool!

And what "thang" would that be?

I don't agree.

Please. We'll see.

haaaa. Okay.

Bottom Line: @CP3 does not want to go the @LAKERS. The @Clippers are an ideal situation for him.

You're probably right. But this is all I know.

In the Philippines?

Okay.

I'm not putting any PG ahead of @Dame_Lillard right now but @StephenCurry30 -- the greatest shooter this world has ever seen. Love @KyrieIrving. Can't wait to see him back out here. His handle is bananas. But Dame is something special. We need to appreciate that man.

You've got me confused with someone else. I have never -- ever -- called Kawhi the best player in the league.

Lakers

The @nuggets

I will say this about going to the Philippines, though: I'm scared as hell to leave the country right now, with all this covid stuff going on. Once things return to normal, I just may head there. Hell, I might have a few fans there :-)

Brooklyn

Not a damn thing!

Yes they can. But they won't.

Depends on preference. He's clearly a better perimeter shooting and a better free throw shooter. That is what I prefer. And @KDTrey5's defense is comparable to @KingJames, as well. But I will concede: LeBron's the champ now. So KD is on the clock.

Thanks bro.

Oh, Yes! I absolutely, positively agree with you.

DON'T tease me like this, DAMMIT!

Thank you. Much appreciated.

I'll tell them if they ask.

Don't struggle against the @dallascowboys playing a QB in his first career start and you won't have me having the @steelers at No. 4

I don't view him as a point guard, but the answer is yes. Jamal Murray is special.

Nope. Because the @nyknicks don't have enough assets to get him. But @JHarden13 would bring the house down if he played at Madison Square Garden 41 nights a year. New York would LOOOOVVVVVVEEEEEEE him.

This would be true.

What was mean?

Haaaa

I don't flip-flop. I have @KDTrey5  when Healthy. But he got hurt, was down and @KingJames. Now KD is on the clock, and I think he'll answer the call. At least to get @BrooklynNets to the Finals. I can't wait for this season. I really can't.

Yeah! But that's nasty, bro. Just nasty!!!

Hell No. Never.

Thank you for your kind words :-)

After giving up 44 points? With that way that defense has been playing? Why the hell would I do that.

Thank you. But you're not getting a shout out because of that, partner. Sorry :-)

I wouldn't go that far. I think at this moment, it's nip-and-tuck between him and Patrick Mahomes. Russell Wilson was right there until his 4-turnover game last weekend.

I believe you should mind your damn business, take notes and recognize what I'm saying is true. Day-to-Day I bring this S*&^$! Remember that.

Amen. Say it again: Amen!!!

yeah! Yeah! It's about that time. @FirstTake coming at you......RIGHT NOW! Who knows, I just might tweet y'all during the entire damn show. I'm just in that kind of mood, today. Watch and react. I'll try to holla back as much as I can.

My top 5 NFL teams right now!

I'll be doing my #NoYouDidnt segment every Tuesday on the 6pm @SportsCenter!

OH NO YOU DIDN'T! This dude USED shorts as his MASK?!?!

Hell yeah Cam should regret going to the Pats!

Love this book by my man @JimGrayOfficial, ‚ÄúTalking To GOATs‚Äù with Ali, Jordan, Kobe, Tyson, LeBron, Phelps, Tiger. Incredible stories. Get it!¬†¬†¬†¬†#TalkingToGOATs

As far as I'm concerned, when @KDTrey5 is healthy, I think he's the BEST.

Hell Yes! Look at the weapons he has to work with!

He's phenomenal. But I don't believe that I'm seeing things from @PatrickMahomes that I never saw from @AaronRodgers12.

I'm disappointed in the @Steelers, and here's why

Be there on @FirstTake tomorrow at 10am EST. I most definitely will be. Haaaaaa!!!!

Y‚Äôall know I had to ask. You know I had to ask about @JHarden13, and whether or not he was in the @HoustonRockets future plans

This is not even a damn discussion. The @WARRIORS have the best shot to Dethrone the @Lakers in the West.. and we all know why!

We all know the answer to this damn question. Don‚Äôt y‚Äôall dare act like you don‚Äôt know. Here‚Äôs a hint: The team with the greatest shooting backcourt known to MAN!

My condolences to @cavs director of scouting, Brandon Weems ‚Äî who‚Äôs sister was murdered. Please follow @KingJames on this one and do all we can to find out who did this.#PrayersUp

I don't mind that either.

Amen

Nobody's coming Bro! Because I'm not going any F&%$ place for a while.......Lord Willing!

I'm out of it, bro. Needed a break. But I'll be back on @FirstTake tomorrow (Friday) morning.

Okay @FirstTake, I‚Äôm watching all of y‚Äôall. Good job. Other than @damienwoody not wearing a tie and having a wrinkled set, I‚Äôm very very pleased :-). Keep it going

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith says the Chiefs >>> Steelers. Do you agree?

My buddy @iamBenLyons started Hoopers Vote in partnership with Rock-The-Vote to drive voter turnout. And look what he took the time to create.

If this were @donovanjmcnabb, what would we be saying?

Who gives a damn. Too little, too late for them.

Do your homework, clown. You're busy paying attention to HOW I say things. Not WHAT I say, because I spit facts. Educate yourself.

The @Buccaneers are going to the Super Bowl.

I'm thinking about it.

you do that

I'm starting to get scared for Anthony Lynn. Can't keep losing that many leads -- with Herbert playing the way he's playing -- and think folks won't come looking for the coach. It's inevitable.

It's about keeping your word. You weren't saying that when he had all his problems and @BronzeBomber gave him a chance.

Yes.

Psychologist.

Hell-To-The-Yes!!!!

I can't believe what I'm about to say, but I really like what I'm seeing from @Bengals right now. I'm impressed. With their QB and their coach. But keep that to yourself:)

Damn right.

He's a fighter. That's how they talk. Get over it. @BronzeBomber is a class guy. He saves all his violence for the ring, which is what we ask and pay that man to do. So what if he's engaging in hyperbole from time-to-time. Makes us what to see the fight even more.

Man, the @dallascowboys are so pathetic, I decided to throw out a mercy rule. It wasn't in my heart to do that to them. I actually felt sorry for them.

Not the point. If @BronzeBomber wants a rematch, and @Tyson_Fury promised him one, keep your word. Damn! Wilder's got one loss on his entire resume. Show him some respect.

I ain't mad at ya. I hear that.

Tell us something we don't know. We've known @Kaepernick7 been blackballed since 2016

Haaaa. I hear ya.

Oh, Shut the Hell up, unless you're going to make some damn sense. You tweet this early in the morning just to say that? Sit down!

.....@Tyson_Fury should honor that. Nobody could ever accuse @BronzeBomber of running from anything or anyone. And he's given numerous guys shots, including Fury. If Wilder wants the trilogy, he's entitled. It's the right thing to do, @Tyson_Fury.

Hey, obviously I think that @BronzeBomber trying to go into the ring with @Tyson_Fury as his next opponent isn't wise. But he DOES have a point. He did give Fury a shot when Fury was having problems. He did take less for the rematch. So if there was a rematch clause, then....

My brother @michaelirvin88 there is no getting through this! Your @dallascowboys stink. They‚Äôre awful. And it‚Äôs primarily because of Pom Pom waivers like you. It‚Äôs nice to see you, though. There‚Äôs been an APB out for you. We know why. It won‚Äôt end. Y‚Äôall lose again..TODAY!

Make sure to vote (üìπ via @babytorpedo22)

I want to see @dmorey bring James Harden to Philly!

Clearly it‚Äôs my trolling. Y‚Äôall think I don‚Äôt know? üòÄüòÄüòÄ

I‚Äôm very happy for manager Dave Roberts! Had he lost this aeries, he would‚Äôve lost his job. Now he‚Äôs a champion. Seems like a great guy, too. Very happy for him

What in God‚Äôs name is wrong with this owner of the @Dodgers? Who writes and reads a long-ass speech like that on the championship stage, stealing that time away from the players and managers and baseball people, like that? Who does that? Come on!

So let me get this straight: @RaysBaseball manager Cash took out Snell, a lefty, vs Betts ‚Äî who batted .218 vs lefties ‚Äî to bring in a R-Hander who‚Äôs given up runs in 6-straight postseason appearances? Sound like the Manager dropped the proverbial ball on this one.

Why in the Hell would Kevin Cash take Snell out of this game at that point, just because he gave up 1 hit??? Why? Why? Why? I mean...I want the @Dodgers to win a WS finally, but damn

The @Buccaneers are going to the Super Bowl.

Enjoyed watching this @IAMATHLETEpod. Good luck fellas on the podcast!!!

It‚Äôs sooooo beautiful to see my man @mspears96 on @GetUpESPN right now. I‚Äôve been looking for him since the @dallascowboys stunk up in the joint on Sunday. Actually had to put an APB out for him. Happy he‚Äôs been found. See you on @FirstTake big boy. Can‚Äôt wait.#Haaaaaa!

I‚Äôve never done this before in the history of @FirstTake

That is a LIE, @Realrclark25. I‚Äôm watching you on @GetUpESPN right now. You said Henry would get humbled. You said the @Titans would lose by double-digits. And because I believed you, I was in panic mode the entire second-half. I‚Äôll deal with you on @FirstTake this morning!

Proud of all of y‚Äôall, Bro. Keep doing. Always here if you need anything.

Damn. Cam looks terrible. There‚Äôs no way around this. That INT was caused by a bad throw to Edelman. This is happening vs Jimmy G, and on the same day @TomBrady is doing his thing. And now, it looks like Belichick has benched him. Awwww Damn!

Haaaaaa!!!!

Yes @michaelirvin88.....I am watching for on @nflnetwork right NOW. Let‚Äôs see how you can possible explain the state of affairs with your pathetic @dallascowboys. Go‚ÄôHead my brother. Be the @dallascowboys‚Äô Pom Pom waiver that you are. I‚Äôm listening (Haaaa)

And......if the @Dodgers lose that series their manager, Dave Roberts, will lose his job.

Wait a damn minute: so on 1 play, the @Dodgers leave in their closer too long, who gives up a hit, the CF commits a fielding error, then the catcher commits an error at home plate after the runner tumbled over like Daniel Jones. I think the @Dodgers just lost this series....

Man. I saw Nurmegomedov stalk @Justin_Gaethje the entire round, get caught twice, and still kept coming, stalking, walking him down. This does not look good for Gaethje. I‚Äôm just saying

Let‚Äôs go y‚Äôall. It‚Äôs about that time. Bigtime @ufc fight. I‚Äôve been waiting for this: Nurmegamedov vs @Justin_Gaethje. The best.....versus someone I think will be if defeats Nurmeg. Let‚Äôs Go!!!

Yeah! Yeah! Stream Khabib vs. Gaethje at 2 PM ET on ESPN+

My reaction to @realStanVG being hired to coach the Pelicans.

It‚Äôs about that time Folks.

Baker Mayfield chirps better than he plays football right now.

Look @damienwoody, I‚Äôm watching you on @GetUpESPN right now. I appreciate your passion and your take on the @dallascowboys. But make sure to remind the world you PICKED them to win the SB last year. And fix your your damn tieüòÄ

This is the first I've heard of such a comment. Once it's confirmed that he said that, I'll address it.

When the hell did Eli Manning look good while Odell was there?

Would never be both, bro.

Haaaaa

Damn right. I meant it, too.

Just don't believe Milwaukee will be able to pull it off.

Be Nice.

So what does that have to do with the price of tea in China?

Free @obj from Cleveland!

Something about this morning was just so lovely.

What CAN go wrong, DID go wrong last night!

Haaaaaa. I wish. I never looked good in my life. Not even if you paid me.

Nobody said @bakermayfield is a scrub. He can play. But cats on frustrated. Some dudes don't believe right now and don't feel like they can afford to wait. He can play, though. His track record says so. But thus far.......

That's because I know what the hell I'm talking about from the inside and you don't. STHU and watch the damn show.

Oh Hell no @mspears96. Put them damn glasses back on when you‚Äôre talking about these @dallascowboys like you promised at the start of @GetUpESPN. And stop cussing, Pastor. You brought this on yourself.#AaaaaHaaaaaa

Aaaaahhhhhhh Haaaaaaaaaa

Was there a game tonight????

YES @OBJ should DEMAND a trade!

I have low expectations for the @DallasCowboys tonight. What can I say

Round 9 I have to @VasylLomachenko. Looked like he almost had Lopez

Yo y‚Äôall. We‚Äôre in round 8 of @TeofimoLopez vs @VasylLomachenko. I don‚Äôt have Loma winning more than 1 round thus far.

The Warriors will be the biggest threat to the Lakers repeating next season!!

RT @GetUpESPN : .@stephenasmith will NEVER rank LeBron ahead of Michael Jordan. The only thing he could do to be even with MJ as the GOAT?

I've got something to say to Jerry Jones

I'm no beauty queen, bro. I don't give a damn.

Wednesday. Not today.

I mean that shit!

yes sirrrrr

Stimulus Package by the NBA. Period. But it is what it is. Y'all want me to let it go? Then don't ask me like folks keep doing. I'm not changing my damn mind on that.

Not the point and you know it. But typical distraction and punk move. Don't want to address the real elephant in the room. Go Figure.

Amen.

Damn Skippy

Thank You.

I have. I will and I will continue too.

Oh, just watch the damn show and STHU

If that's what you peeled from my point of view, you're more clueless than you sound.

My heart goes out to @dak.

It wasn‚Äôt just miscommunication or botched plays I‚Äôm talking about @mspears96 & @Realrclark25  I‚Äôm talking lack of effort by that @LSUfootball defense. They should be ashamed to wear that uniform. I‚Äôm dead-up serious. They had guys running away from tackling.#F$&$Pathetic.

Yo! @mspears96 and @Realrclark25...I‚Äôm not even joking around when I say this and I hope your @LSUfootball‚Äô defense hears this: that performance today was one of the most pathetic, lackadaisical performances I‚Äôve ever witnessed. They should be ashamed of themselves.

Damn! Metchie III and @AlabamaFTBL know how to cover an Onside kick better than the damn @AtlantaFalcons of the @NFL

Gotta admit: this Red River Rivalry never gets old. What a comeback by @TexasFootball...down 31-17 with 3 1/2 minutes left, they‚Äôve now tied the score at 31. This is good

Major props to the Heat.

Yes! Big Ben to Claypool......55-yard bomb down left sideline, he scampers in the rest of the way. Touchdown. @Steelers up 14-3

Ouch! @EzekielElliott literally runs right over some dude named Kazee. @AtlantaFalcons‚Äô defense looked soft and weak on that series. Let‚Äôs see what they do from here. Btw....my @steelers are winning and @AaronRodgers12 is coming back on the @Lions. Stay Tumed

Btw.....I‚Äôm watching several games. The bad news is that the @Eagles look sorry and flat. They‚Äôre getting their asses kicked by the @LARams. At least the @dallascowboys ‚Äî down 20-0 right now ‚Äî have someone else losing right along with them.

The @dallascowboys hold on 3-&-7 but.....waiting for it: Holding penalty on @juliojones_11. That would mean an automatic First Down for the @AtlantaFalcons. Stay Tuned üòÄüòÄüòÄ

Uh! That would be another fumble by the @@dallascowboys. That would be 4 ‚Äî count‚Äôem 4 ‚Äî fumbles by the @dallascowboys in the 1ST QUARTER. Let‚Äôs see what will happen  with the @AtlantaFalcons in this short drive

The @AtlantaFalcons have kicked a FG. They are now up 17-0. Just saying:-)

Uh! That was just a fake punt in 4th-and-3 on their own 29-Yard line and the @dallascowboys ‚Äî fresh off a terrible year in Special Teams last season ‚Äî messed up again. @AtlantaFalcons ball. Again, just letting y‚Äôall know.

Oh. Excuse me. The @AtlantaFalcons just scored another TD on a 42-Yard pass from Ryan-to-Hearst. So it really is 14-0. Just wanted to keep all you @dallascowboys fans in the loop, that‚Äôs all. Nothing more (Haaaaaaaa!!!!!)

Uh, @EzekielElliott has fumbled TWICE; second fumble recovered by the @AtlantaFalcons . Now they are driving downfield, threatening to go up 14-0. Just thought I‚Äôd let y‚Äôall know

They Say Imitation is the greatest form of flattery......so I guess they are right because I‚Äôm VERY flattered that this young lady recalled every word I said. Touching! (Haaaaaa)

Don‚Äôt Remind me. Please.....don‚Äôt remind me

Absolutely correct

You are correct. I DO see. For Now!!!

The @Lakers are looking strong tonight. They‚Äôre defending. Role players are hitting perimeter shots. @KingJames is pushing folks around. And @DwightHoward is damn-near bullying Jokic. They should cruise to the title.

I think this @Heat/@Celtics series is over.

I voted for @KingJames to be MVP. I think he deserved it.

What‚Äôs up, @Kuz. We don‚Äôt understand English now? I was not comparing the games nor accomplishments of @DwightHoward and @Yg_Trece (Paul George). I was simply saying both left smaller markets, ended up on larger market teams, didn‚Äôt win the chip, and end up moving. Am I Wrong?

Thank you, @AtlantaFalcons.

Got a little surprise for y‚Äôall on @FirstTake at the top of the hour. An old friend is paying y‚Äôall a visit (Haaaaaaaa)

Monday

It‚Äôs @SportsCenter hosted by ya boy, returning at 5pm EST!!! See y‚Äôall there!

I believe Paul George is in danger of becoming the second-coming of Dwight Howard.

Kawhi Leonard - that might be the biggest choke job we've seen in NBA history!

ü§£ü§£ü§£ @maxkellerman

I‚Äôve specifically stayed off the grid this morning JUST to save everything ounce of energy I have for @FirstTake . I‚Äôll tell you this though: @maxkellerman has never been in more trouble than he is today. Get your popcorn ready. I‚Äôm already out of the control.

OMG CLIPPERS!!!

It is Game 7.  And who is the best player on the court? It ain‚Äôt Kawhi Leonard, that‚Äôs for damn sure. It is @BeMore27. AGAIN!!!!

Okay Ladies & Gentlemen. I‚Äôm officially nervous for the @Clippers. The game is not only close, but the Clips are up. WTH! I‚Äôm getting very very nervous damnit. I want @Lakers vs @LAClippers

This dude Jokic is ridiculous. The man can‚Äôt jump from the street onto a fur, but damn he can play. Leading fast breaks. Doing spin moves. Fall-away jump shots. He‚Äôs just unreal. If the @LAClippers allow this to be close, this man is going to be a problem. But I still pick Clips.

You better NOT lose this damn series, @LAClippers!!!

What can go wrong, WILL go wrong, @mspears96!!!!!

Absolutely stupid take on your part. Why the hell would I want to see anyone at this point more than Kawhi vs. @KingJames??? Have you lost your damn mind

Ya Damn Skippy!!!

False. I said I was losing faith in the Lakers because of their lack of perimeter shooting, especially since Avery Bradley elected not to play. I also admitted the Clippers were the better team. But never did I said I'm officially changing my pick. Hell....I still don't know.

False. I never have bad takes, but I hear ya.

That's a damn lie. I specifically banned the Brady/Cliff convo for months until we started back up, so stop your lying. If you don't want to watch, take your damn negativity somewhere else. But don't lie to do it.

I honestly have no idea what you're talking about

Don't forget the Nature Boy @RicFlairNatrBoy. He's in play for No.1 ALL TIME....when it comes to giving motivational speeches, my man :-)

I hear you loud and clear, bro. It could happen. But I believe in the @Clippers tonight. I can't believe they're going to blow this.

No! I reminded them of what they need to do tonight. Stop F*&^ing around and close this thing out.

Damn right!!!

RT @artisttheme : After that closing statement from @stephenasmith for game 7 tonight   for the Clippers/Nuggets matchup uh I need him in my corner before a boxing match #FirstTake

Damn Right!

I don't know if Kawhi has ever been under more pressure in his career.

Wow.. Southern Stevie just cannot figure out how to blame for that dang @Cowboys loss

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith is holding Kawhi accountable for Clippers‚Äô loss in Game 6.

What an absolutely beautiful morning üòÄ

Great start to the season, COWBOYS!! üòÄüòÄüòÄ

OMG!!! The @nuggets have gone from a 17-point deficit to an 11-point lead. They have FORCED a GAME 7. I am absolutely positively STUNNED!!! This is unreal. The @LAClippers are in a world of trouble!!!

Holy S$@&!!! I thought the @LAClippers had this series. They were up 17. I blink, and now they‚Äôre down 4. Could there be a Game 7? Hold onto your seats!

Ok! Ok, Valdez-Scantling! You damn well had better caught that last pass. Otherwise I would‚Äôve screamed for @AaronRodgers12 ‚Äî that Baaaaaaaaaadddddd Man ‚Äî to not throw you the damn ball anymore. Btw.......is anyone watching the show Rodgers is putting on?#Y‚ÄôallMustHaveForgot

WTH!  Now that‚Äôs the 2nd damn drop Marquez Valdez-Scantling dropped right in his hands from @AaronRodgers12. This time a 60-yard bomb. WTH! Catch the damn ball, man.

@TheNBACentral Awwwwww Shit!!!!!

What the NFL players were doing was completely American, as I told @smerconish.

Amen!

Incredible respect to @MeyersLeonard of the @MiamiHEAT and his brother for their interview on @NBAonTNT right now. Seems like a really good dude. Perfect explanation for why he stood for Nat‚Äôl Anthem. Hearts clearly in the right place. Hoping nothing but the best for both.

I didn‚Äôt mean to go here. But since the conversation was opened by @dak ‚Äî which we all should appreciate‚Äî I just felt if we‚Äôre really going to talk about it, let‚Äôs do it.

Dak.......and my comments on Depression.

Unfortunately, this is not surprising about the NFL fans & Social Justice. But there‚Äôs an upside:

My prayers to you and your family.

Thanks so much.

Outside of @saquon, who gives a DAMN about the Giants right now???

MVP of this game is KyleLowry. Just a sensational performance on his part. 3‚Äôs, steals, offensive fouls drawn. What a performance. Btw....what a game, period!

RT @ESPNPR : NBA Countdown will serve as the pregame & halftime show for the #NBA Finals on @ABCNetwork & Eastern Conference Finals on ESPN

NBA Countdown at top of the hour on @ESPN. Y'all know the drill!

NO I'm not classifying the @packers as contenders. And I will admit it's strictly EMOTIONAL!

WTH is this world coming to? Rajon Rondo is out here here hitting 3‚Äôs???? Lord Have Mercy. If that continues, maybe the @Lakers will win it after all.

Yo @maxkellerman, your praising @kawhileonard b/c he blocked a shot with his middle finger. You see the block party @KingJames is putting on tonight? Plus his offense? Looks like there‚Äôs a real battle for best in the world to me!

Who cares how you feel about GIANNIS, @Espngreeny??? üòÄüòÄ

RT @GetUpESPN : .@stephenasmith doesn't see another super star player coming to join Giannis with the Bucks.

Check the resume

RT @47jasonn : @stephenasmith looking fresh on NBA Countdown !

Major major props to @Khris22m and @EBled2 for saving the @Bucks season. I honestly didn‚Äôt think they would do it ‚Äî or could ‚Äî without @Giannis_An34. I really didn‚Äôt. I was WRONG. This is the Middleton I‚Äôve been waiting to see for years. Way to step up. Props are due!

I love Steve Nash! But.......

I love Steve Nash! But....... I'll be sharing my views at the beginning of @FirstTake!

Awwwwww S$&@!!! I have some news right at the top of @FirstTake take damnit.....and I‚Äôm PISSED!!!

Awwwww Shit! If the game is tight, who do we trust? @CP3? @russwest44? Or @JHarden13. Good lord. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs come down to this!

Alright now. @russwest44 is not playing. 3-big plays to end the 3rd QT. Attacking in the 4th......while @JHarden13 is struggling. This are getting very interesting.

That is absolutely, positively, a shameful call by Marc Davis. How can you make that ticky-taco call in that situation! I picked the @MiamiHEAT to win this series, but to make that call in a time game with 0:00 on the clock is disgraceful. @Bucks should‚Äôve walked off before FT‚Äôs

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Duty calls. The MOB needs me in Port Charles. Here I Come, @GeneralHospital!  Here I come! Look out for my return coming very soon :-)

My reaction to the Nuggets taking Game 7.

Dwyane Wade 2.0 has arrived

Correct. But all that means is that I was wrong.....NOT that I DON'T say what I feel.

As bad as @Russwest44 struggle late in Game six, the biggest culprit for the loss is someone else. Play the damn video and find out!!!

Come check me out on NBA Countdown at ESPN top of the hour!! HUGE day ahead of basketball, y'all.

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith thinks there will be problems around the league if Mike D'Antoni ends up in Indiana after a round one loss, specifically with Black coaches.

Let's get READY to RUMBLE! @RumbleMovie

Very EXCITED to be part of @RumbleMovie!!!!!

So far as @CP3, we simply can‚Äôt say enough about the guy. Social Justice Issues/Boycotts. The playoffs. Both a leader on the court w/ the playoffs and a President of the @TheNBPA. And this guy goes out, plays like that & forces a Game 7. Unreal! Just absolutely unreal!#PROPS

The @HoustonRockets just lost this game. A big reason is @russwest44, who looked off all night and was a turnover machine (he‚Äôll be back, though). But the biggest reason is Coach D‚ÄôAntoni. How in the hell do you have the last 3 possessions w/o @JHarden13 w/ ball? I mean WTH!!!

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith remembers how John Thompson‚Äôs protest of Proposition 48 paved the way for today‚Äôs athletes fighting for racial justice.

Beautiful interview by @BeMore27 post-game on the court ‚Äî paying tribute to George Floyd & Breonna Taylor.....capping a spectacular performance with thoughtfulness and compassion. Way to go, bro. Keep shining!

Oh, we all know @BeMore27 isn‚Äôt the only superstar the court. That man @spidadmitchell is that dude. He‚Äôs that special, too. Appropriate that this looks like it‚Äôs going to a Game 7. We‚Äôre all in for a treat.

This dude @BeMore27 is special.....just special. He‚Äôs emerging into a superstar before our very eyes. That is when superstars are made, btw ‚Äî the playoffs. Not the regular season.

R.I.P. My Brother. We will miss you!

This is what I heard about LEBRON coming out of Thursday‚Äôs meeting.

UNDEFEATED!!!!!

I believe Michael Jordan to be one of the most underappreciated people in American history.

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith talks about overcoming racism in America.

Nope

Hell yeah

I‚Äôm trying

Oh, I still mean that shit. Don‚Äôt conflate this issue with what Kyrie proposed at the beginning. Ain‚Äôt trying to fool anyone. I meant exactly what the hell I said. The players should‚Äôve played then. They should play now.

No comment :-)

He‚Äôll No. I wasn‚Äôt wrong then and I‚Äôm not wrong now. I said WYH I meant and meant WTH I said. You forget who I am??? I say what I mean.......unless I‚Äôm on @GeneralHospital :-)

MY RETURN to NBA Countdown... tonight 8pm EST! Buckle up for a special show.

I was very hurt seeing NFL EVP @TroyVincentSr like this.

I‚Äôm fine with that response. So tell me: What should they do from here?

Absolutely true. Until moments when they felt someone else should be while he was working Capitol Hill.

I understand. Not a bad idea.

@ShamsCharania If this is True ‚Äî if LeBron decides to end the season ‚Äî the NBA Season has unofficially come to an end.

I do think the NBA season will continue. But things ARE dicey

SO proud of the NBA players.

View all the damn details here!

GUESS WHO IS JOINING NBA Countdown!!!!

NOPE, Max should no longer be able to talk basketball after this!

Still skeptical about the Lakers for this reason.

Just one BLACK experience with the Police. There have been many good ones. This wasn‚Äôt one of them. @KingJames is right.

Here is what I want White America to understand.

I have called the POLICE. I have put out an APB for @Yg_Trece!. This is what‚Äôs called for when you‚Äôre shootings less that 25% FG the last 3 games and folks are tweeting me, calling him ‚ÄúPandemic P.‚Äù

Hey @NBAonTNT guys. It‚Äôs alright to say Brett Brown has to go.  We don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs sad. He‚Äôs a good man. But you can‚Äôt keep underachieving. Yeah, @JoelEmbiid and @BenSimmons25 got to get better. But the Coach has to help get them there. Period!

Props to Montrezl Harrell for apologizing. In these times things can definitely be interpreted in a bad way. He was wrong. He manned up. Apologized man-to-man. Bigger props to @LukaDoncic for ‚Äúaccepting‚Äù it. He didn‚Äôt have to, but he did. THIS IS HOW MEN handle things!

Stop all of that noise Chuck on @NBAonTNT. @Shaq & @TheJetOnTNT are absolutely right. Kawhi cannot switch on the last play w/ @luka7doncic having the ball. How did he get his first Finals MVP? He defended @KingJames. Operative word=DEFEND! So Stop it right now!

Ummm! Btw......@spidadmitchell has now scored 14-Straight for @utahjazz. Just saying!

This dude @spidadmitchell = SPECIAL. Love this brother. Putting on a show tonight vs @nuggets (no more state downs, Millsap! You see where that gotcha). Bad news? The brother could‚Äôve been a @nyknicks. This is the sadness that takes over my basketball life.

OMG! OMG! OMG! @luka7doncic with the Game Winning 3 over Reggie Jackson at the buzzer. Holy S$&@! I AM SOLD, Ladies & Gentlemen. I AN Sold! @maxkellerman called it. Gotta give him credit. The @dallasmavs are LIVE. @LAClippers, what‚Äôs up? No @kporzee and this still happened. Yo?

Not that I had much reservation about @luka7doncic to begin with, but it‚Äôs officially over now. On ONE Ankle ‚Äî 1 ‚Äî this brother has 40-17-13. I‚Äôm done. I have nothing else to say other than: this brother is the TRUTH.

I still think @Lakers vs. @Blazers is going to 7 GAMES. So long as @DamianLilliard can be Dame

Best player in the NBA right now.

Damn @Dame_Lillard. This brother just pulled up from the parking lot. Damn!!!

That was a bogus, bogus ejection for @kporzee

@CP3 @NBA @TheNBPA @Disney You should be very proud @CP3. What a fantastic job all if you have done. What a standard you guys have set for us all. Focus, discipline, sacrifice, performance. True Role Models. Way To Go!

I'm not completely jumping off of the @Lakers bandwagon, but I'm NERVOUS!

This was from my appearance on ‚ÄúThe Steam Room‚Äù with @TurnerSportsEJ and Charles Barkley.

This is the first time I felt like I made it.

Welcome to the world of the student-athlete.

RT @GetUpESPN : .@stephenasmith thinks that asking players to not have "visitors" inside the team bubble constitutes as cruel and unusual punishment üòÖ

Apparently not. @CarisLeVert has destroyed the @trailblazers guards. Except for that last shot. Nothing wrong with the step-back. Just missed it.

Big time steak by @Dame_Lillard. Big time pull-up jumper by @CJMcCollum. @trailblazers are now up 4 with 53 seconds left. But can they get a stop

And BTW......although it IS vs these @trailblazers, these @BrooklynNets are looking pretty damn good. So imagine if @KDTrey5 and @KyrieIrving we‚Äôre healthy? Just think about what they could do.

Don‚Äôt like the fact that @Dame_Lillard just gave up that back-door cut, but make no mistake: he IS the MVP of this bubble. 8-of-13 from 3, and 39 points ‚Äî with still 6 minutes to play. Win or lose, he‚Äôs the MVP of Bubble Play. But win this game, damnit.

OMG! @Dame_Lillard just pulled up from the damn LOGO near mid court. Nothing but net. The way the @trailblazers are playing ‚Äî jacking up 3‚Äôs and missing them ‚Äî it may take Dame doing that to win this game.

I think they are crossing the line with the bubble visitor restrictions!

Here's my issue with Jerry Jones.

C‚ÄôMON, @obj.

I applaud what the NBA players are doing. I hope it doesn't stop.

How I stay true to myself, as told to @SHODesusAndMero...

Sooo true.

Yeeeeesssssssss!!!!!!!!!

Finally @FirstTake is on at its regular time ‚Äî 10am to Noon. Finally! Buckle up!

First, the @Lakers struggled to beat the short-handed @LAClippers. Now, the @Raptors are running them off the court tonight. The Champions look fresh and ready. We‚Äôre learning who really used this off-time to stay sharp and who‚Äôs been a little lax.#Hmmm!!!

Hey! I know it‚Äôs been nearly a 5-month lay-off and the @LAClippers are the superior team, but damn @PelicansNBA!!! Can y‚Äôall at least ACT like y‚Äôall are interested in playing ball and trying to make the playoffs? Passes! Dribbling! Movement! All of it non-existent. Damn!!!

Well-Deserved my man. All the best in your future endeavors. We all know it‚Äôll involve big things.......because it‚Äôs you!#Onward&Upward

What a wonderful, touching tribute. Any man should aspire to earn that kind of love and adulation. #PropsToTheGolics #ThankYouGolic

Just finished watching the tribute @espngolic received from his son and his family. And here‚Äôs what I walked away with: No matter what he gave us over 20 great years on radio, evidently it‚Äôs nothing compared to what he‚Äôs given his wife and children all these years.

If Paul George is like THAT in the playoffs, watch out!

NBA players should be applauded for kneeling last night. But there are mixed emotions ‚Äî a flip side ‚Äî that comes with this, in my opinion.

I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcriticize‚Äù the players. I said I had mixed emotions upon seeing it because it‚Äôs something that could‚Äôve happened years ago if they felt that passionate about it. But then a debate ensued. That‚Äôs how it goes.

False. But I‚Äôm in no mood to entertain your ignorance today.

Main Event: I‚Äôve got Usman winning all 5 rounds. He wrestled. Plain and simple, completely stymieing Masvidal. I feel bad for Masvidal because that‚Äôs not the kind of fight that‚Äôs made him box office. Usman is big time, but was boring. But he got it done.

I‚Äôm sorry but that was not a good decision I had Holloway winning the first 3 rounds. Volkanovski closed the distance and took Round 4 easily, plus win around 5. But I had him losing the fight 3 Rounds to 2. Bad decision in my opinion.

This simply needed to be said. Sorry!

Hey @tanklawrence, I'm glad you introduced yourself to this topic. I'm watching all of @Cowboys nation on Jerry Jones. Hell, I may even put out an APB. Hope he‚Äôs healthy & safe though.

I don't agree with how @Prez has been handling this.

Is completely unacceptable from him right now, @TankLawrence. Period. I‚Äôm not going away on this. And neither should any Black Man wearing a @dallascowboys uniform right now. Have a blessed day.

Over the years @TankLawrence. I ain‚Äôt questioning that, bro. This is about Jerry Jones, and what power his words can wield. And if he doesn‚Äôt want to exercise that, we have a right to know why.....based on HIS history. I‚Äôm not saying WHAT he should say. Just that SILENCE

To doing @TankLawrence. And that‚Äôs simply being heard. It‚Äôs a damn shame that I‚Äôm the one calling for it instead of some of at least SOME of the fellas wearing a @dallascowboys uniform. And needless to say, I‚Äôm not joking. This ain‚Äôt about your history or you wonderful work

McCoy. So again @TankLawrence, with all due respect, try aiming your ire, disgust, etc., in a different direction. Not this way.....on this issue. All I‚Äôve called for is for Jerry Jones to SPEAK. Why? Because White Silence Is Compliance. I want JJ to do what he‚Äôs been addicted

Forget the obvious position we‚Äôd all take in favor of NASCAR‚Äôs Bubba Wallace right. Don‚Äôt take sides. Just look at this video and ask: How should we all feel about this.

My reaction to the noose being found in Bubba Wallace's garage.

We disagree on that. I believe you feel that way because you may disagree. But the first move is getting to actually address issues instead of sweeping them under the rug. ESPN does that. I do that. And it's because of that that dissenting views are heard.#FACTS

When we give a Frogs Phat Ass about what you think we'll be sure to let you know.

Do me a favor and STHU, please. We attacked the @Jets because we were discussing Jamal Adams. Not Covid-19. Do you need your ears unwaxed or something?

Can't put me before Kobe, my man. But I appreciate the gesture. Thank you.

I like the idea of each NFL team being bubbled in their own respective city. They charter jets to the games on the road, stay confined, then head back home thereafter. That seems more reasonable that confining them all to a bubble in the same city.

I‚Äôm sure Felicia Spencer is a quality fighter but I can‚Äôt imagine her winning this fight. In fact, I can‚Äôt imagine a woman in the world beating Amanda Nunes right now. KO by round 2. Could end in 1. Nunes, of course.

Good lord. What a Knockout at the Buzzer by @Cody_Nolove over @Raphael Assuncao. Garbrandt looked so much faster all night, but I didn‚Äôt expect this. Great job by him!

Thank you bro.

And let me go a step further. I'm so sick of folks NOT getting this game we live in. My sista, @karenhunter always ask: What have you built? Do you know how to build? It's a relevant question, because you can't build anything without a plan. You damn-sure can't sustain.

My position on KAP was clear. It still hasn't changed. He was blackballed. It was straight B.S. that he was kept out of the league. And he was right to sue. BUT....from there, where was your plan?? That's exactly what I said and I meant that S%$#. I still DO mean that it.

Haaaaa. Really, you wondering why? Come on, man. If anyone of them speak, they'll have to admit what was done to @Kaepernick7 was wrong. Hence, lawsuit, which is money out of their pocket. Remember, they kept him out because they THOUGHT he's bad for $$$.

I've spoken about it and will continue to speak about it. I'm an HBCU grad. It's my home base. I will always support HBCU's. Some players will go. Unfortunately, most will follow the money. If not to CBB, then to the NBA's G-League before heading to NBA. We know this.

Thank you, Max.

That's emotion talking. Stop wasting my time.

That's a non-football (on field, that is) point you just made. That's an entirely different argument, but incredibly valid on your part.

PLEASE.

See.............lawsuit. Still wondering why the @nflcommish didn't mention his name.#Woke

Send it to ESPN. I'll get it. And I WILL wear it.

Damn Right!

Wasn't his coach Chip Kelly? That would explain a few things. He certainly wasn't bad under Harbaugh.

Appreciate ya, bro.

Stop that nonsense. An explanation is not needed. We all know @Kaepernick7 was blackballed, so bringing up multiple QB's is a moot point. Move forward. That's a reality 3-years old......and counting.

It's a new day. We're not taking S@%$ anymore. And a younger generation of white folks are sick and tired of having to deal with the fallout that history has shouldered them with, so locking arms with black folks. As long as that stays the case, America is destined for Change.

I appreciate what Kanye did here.

Honestly, If I have to compare the two, I see @Kaepernick7 getting a job back in the NFL BEFORE I SEE @nflcommish kneeling. But the way these players are speaking up right now, if it continues, who knows? Both could go down.

You can choose to look at it that way. Or....you can choose to separate the two issues. @Kaepernick7 THE MAN is worth a helluva lot more than just Football. @Kaepernick7 the football player hasn't played in 3 years. Hence,....the tryout would be necessary.

The apology is NOT COMING, bro. Trust me on that. The owners won't allow it. And a commissioner can't violate that......unless they're assured of immunity from a lawsuit.

Amen.

Works for me.

Stop that! He's been out of the league since 2016. I don't give a damn if it were @TomBrady. If you've been out of the league for 3 years, you need to tryout.

You too, bro.

All of us should. Most of us Will. My comment about "It is what it is" was pertaining to what to expect from @nflcommish....who answers to the owners.

Again, he can't bro. I don't believe that will ever happen because of what I explained earlier. But who knows.

I'm honestly not so sure about that. I'll look into that.

.....WATCHES. No politics. No animosity. Nothing. Just an open and fair tryout so he can show his skills. And let the chips fall where they may. Aside from that, see y'all in D.C. in August.

....owners ain't having that. They cut @nflcommish's check. Let's not act like we don't know this. It is what it is in that regard. But it doesn't mean that significant change isn't coming. Personally, I hope someone simply gives @Kaepernick7 a legitimate tryout. As the WORLD

The league is 70% black. There wouldn't be an @NFL w/o black players. They're standing up and not having it anymore. @nflcommish knows this. So he'll definitely act...in some capacity. But not to the point where he names names (.i.e. @Kaepernick7) and invites a lawsuit. The.....

You'll be waiting forever if you expect a "direct" apology from @nflcommish or the @NFL to @Kaepernick7. Goodell never said his name for a reason: It opens the door for a lawsuit. Probably instantly, because it would be an admission. No reporting here. Just common sense.

True. But not the same when it comes to NFL players.

Very much at time. But I‚Äôm made for it.

My reaction to Drew Brees.

My pleasure.

To learn more about what others think. Can‚Äôt win at chess when you‚Äôre playing checkers.

One is a product of the other. So the answer is both.

I said his words YESTERDAY were ‚Äúignorant.‚Äù I did not call HIM ‚Äúignorant.‚Äù There‚Äôs a difference. A grown up understands that. Children don‚Äôt.

I was not talking of Rioters. Protesters = yes! I said it. Because that‚Äôs what I consider the young black brothers & sisters out there ‚Äî fighting on behalf of ALL OF US: soldiers! In no way do I mean to offend military personnel by saying that. But that is what I view them as.

Damn right. Upset that it was Drew Brees who revealed that level of insensitivity & ignorance. But love that it happened because it‚Äôs further evidence as to why we should act as we are right now. NEXT Move: Federal Legislation: PD Violence vs. unarmed Black men= Hate Crime

I don't know what the hell Vic Fangio is talking about.

RT @ARBernard : #blackouttuesday

Yes I have. Which is why I tweeted what I did. The fight is long. Ain't short. Need all of us.

Thank you bro.

B.S. PROTESTING has worked. Not Rioting.....more so looting, to be specific. It empowers those who want to oppress us to justify and validate their actions. And when the smoke clears, we‚Äôre left holding the proverbial bag.

Damn right I do.

We agree that regarding a lot of them. Fair enough.

Hell No! I will do no such thing. I supported the man kneeling. How could I not? But once he said he wanted to play football, what‚Äôs wrong with asking ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your plan?‚Äù I stand by that. and I don‚Äôt give a damn who has a problem with that. That is how I feel. Period.

Then you should be laughing instead of whining and moaning.

It‚Äôs been about 4 years. I have relatives and friends in Detroit. Now what? WTF is your point?

FYI......@FirstTake will be delayed a few minutes this morning due to Korean Baseball. Since it just ended, @GetUpESPN is on for two hours, and @FirstTake will come on around 10:08 am EST. See y'all then.

Amen.

Actually, no. Because I'm not surprised at all. I'm more focused on the others on Capitol Hill who have to power to provoke the change most of us are looking for.

Okay. You're prerogative. Come to me when it works.

And rioting has? When?

You're an idiot. I didn't know this man. And I take pictures with almost anyone who ask. You know how many people took pictures with Trump and others? So what. Grow the hell up!

You damn right I WON'T. I always expressed support for his kneeling. What I did not support -- and never will -- was his failure to have a plan once he kneeled. I said it in the past. I said it recently. And I'll say it again. I'm not budging.

If I had sons, I would. And I speak from experience because I went to one myself: Winston-Salem State.

The corrupt ones will get theirs. Don't empower them by playing into their hands.

This ain't the way, bro. If this were a winning solution I'd be all for it. Certainly not blaming any of us for our feelings. But like I said earlier, the Detroit riots were more than 52 years ago. That city still has not recovered.

Forget him. This is about your life once this subsides. The emotions have been expressed. Not it's about implementing a plan and executing. Don't fall for the okey doke. What's happening in the streets right now is not a winning solution.

Pay attention to what I'm saying instead of your emotions. I care about the riots because of the overall impact anything other than peaceful protest will have on OUR COMMUNITY. Like I said: pay attention.

You sound like you believe you're ultimately hurting themselves more than you're hurting yourself or others who are oppressed. And that's simply not true.

Where is what's happening going to get us? Detroit rioted in the late 60's. More than 50 years later they still haven't recovered. The frustration, the ire, is legit for us all. But where is looting and rioting going to get US in the end?

But please......Keep on MARCHING. By all means......MARCH. PEACEFULLY!!!!! Keep your head up and March peacefully!

Honest to God, I cannot believe what I‚Äôm seeing: PEACEFUL PROTESTERS getting tear gassed ‚Äî shot at with rubber bullets. WTH!!! People.....please, please please stop the rioting. Stop the looting. All it does is empower him. Do not provide ammunition or validation.#ChillOut!

Forgive the typo. I said Gaethje. It said Garth. But y‚Äôall know who I‚Äôm talking about :-)

Damn! The way I see Gaethje connecting on some of these blows ‚Äî not all, just some ‚Äî I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm looking at @Canelo. That is.....until he got caught with that upper cut.

Good Lord. Ferguson is getting hit with some shots. Garth came ready tonight He can really fight. Power in both hands. Good boxing skills. But Ferguson can take a punch.

Understand why official just stopped the CEJUDO fight. Incredible knee-shot CEJUDO caught Cruz with. But Cruz did look like he was trying to get up. Guess you‚Äôve got to lean on the side of caution.

I am absolutely loving this @ufc249 event. Surprisingly, the absence of the crowd has had very little effect on the entertainment value of this event. Live sports. Live entertainment. Damn I missed this!!!

I was not aware he wanted to wear No. 10. And I don‚Äôt have a problem with this brother‚Äôs skills. He‚Äôs special. But No. 88 is special.

Wouldn‚Äôt say he was better than the Playmaker. But he was the original. We must all respect our elders

Regarding what?

RT @espn : In less than a week, Alex Smith went from starting at QB for the Redskins to fighting for his life.

I was reminiscing with my man @TheJetOnTNT...

@espnmma @Cowboycerrone @bokamotoESPN I‚Äôm, so all you MMA folks ‚Äî who I profoundly respect ‚Äî am I off my rocker now??? When you‚Äôve covered sports intimately as a reporter for a quarter-century, you see things sometimes. I respect the hell out of @Cowboycerrone, but he just wasn‚Äôt there that night.

Excited to join my man @TheJetOnTNT very soon! Tune-in SHORTLY.

This man @MelKiperESPN is something else. He brought it today on @FirstTake. Love, Love, Love this man. But I‚Äôm gonna get him. No one is allowed to come on the air in defense of the damn @Bengals and get away with it.#Haaaa ü§£

What the Hell @packers! I understand the draft is just getting started, and that J-Love has some talent. But how about prioritizing help for my man @AaronRodgers12. WTH!!!!! Damn!

@KendrickPerkins @RealJayWilliams @FirstTake False! He was asked a question big bro. He didn‚Äôt gone on the air and volunteer. Plus, he was speaking as a guest, still on the team. You‚Äôve retired and took sides with one player up against the next. Pay attention to what I said. Or better yet, next time just call. U know the #

Tonight at 6pm EST I will be doing a live interview for @hbcuweek. You can register HERE!

I always say this.

Winning these debates is TOO DAMN EASY sometimes!

I Thank God every day that my Lil‚Äô Bro ‚Äî @AllenIverson ‚Äî and I speak all the time now. When you go 2 years without talking to each other, you don‚Äôt expect a relationship to turn out the way ours has.

I joined @LeBatardShow for their podcast, and you‚Äôll want to listen!!

I think @Money23Green made fair points in regards to @KDTrey5.

üí§üí§üí§üí§....this is how I get anytime @JayWilliams tries to portray the @Bucks as champions. Mad respect to all of them, especially the Greek Freak. But I ain‚Äôt believing it until I see it.

Thank You my brother.

Who the hell knows. I don‚Äôt compare myself to NBA players. I show them that respect. They were good enough to make the league. I couldn‚Äôt shine any of their shoes. I just compare them to one another.....then call it like I see it. Always have. Always will.

Thank you bro. Appreciate the love.

Haaaaa. I guess I have that potential on occasion.

Actually, it was 8. And hell no he would not have done that back in the day.

Damn Right!

Thank you.

All depends on the team when it comes to football, bro.

Please! Keep dreaming.

My brother, I truly don‚Äôt give a damn if it‚Äôs what I believe and I have facts to back it up. I‚Äôm not here to win popularity contests like I‚Äôm some politician. That ain‚Äôt me.

OF COURSE! But they‚Äôre smart to capitalize off of it because Owners do it. Plus, if it‚Äôs there, somebody has to get it. They should always get all they can.

BLASPHEMY

That‚Äôs true.

Let‚Äôs not act surprised here, people. With debates, you‚Äôre not suppose to give a damn about what ppl may feel or how they may react at the expense of what you believe to be true. You say what you mean, mean WTH you say, and live with whatever!. That‚Äôs it! Deal with it!

Had a great time appearing on @WendyWilliams‚Äô show. Full interview dropping later!!

With ‚ÄúThe Last Dance‚Äù scheduled to come on ESPN tomorrow night, here‚Äôs a little quiz that was thrown my way.

Like I keep telling y‚Äôall....‚ÄùThe Last Dance‚Äù is gonna be must-see TV. I can‚Äôt wait!

So DAMN excited! Loving these five minutes that just dropped from #TheLastDance #DAMN!

With all due respect to @SHAQ‚Äôs comments, Michael Jordan's Bulls would have SMOKED them.

Enjoyed chatting with @MadisonSiriusXM!

If I was @dak, I'd be DISGUSTED with the Dallas Cowboys.

It would break my heart if the Cowboys decided to trade Dak Prescott ü§†

Typo. I wrote ‚ÄúHe just needs to use his wheels more!‚Äù

Oh Lord

I‚Äôm aware of that. I was talking about what their team did last LAST SEASON. And how he developed later in the season because of it. Sorry for the mix up

Words can‚Äôt begin to express my sincere sadness to you and your family for your loss @KarlTowns. Unfortunately, I have some idea as to how you must be feeling right now. Your mom was one special lady. My condolences to you and yours my brother.#StayStrong

I'm incredibly disappointed in @Dak. Makes no sense to do what he did. 30 ppl? 10 ppl? It don‚Äôt matter right now

RT @FirstTake : ANSWER THE QUESTION!

@PelicansNBA Green Smoothie. All day everyday

Can LeBron equal or pass MJ as a worldwide brand one day? I wouldn't rule it out.

Just Esteban

I believed that before the season was suspended. Everything else is contingent on what guys did to stay in shape in case they do have to return.

Yes.

All the time.

And it‚Äôs very much appreciated.

When I pass away.

Thank you so much. Your kind words are much appreciated.

No. 1 = Dr. J. No. 2 = Andrew Toney

Why not! Especially if he‚Äôs willing to play the slot.

Good point. I‚Äôll monitor that.

No. But I will start once all of this is over.

That‚Äôs a dumb-ass question. Or you simply are deaf and can‚Äôt hear. I NEVER fail to give Drew Brees credit.

Depends on what you‚Äôre looking for. A lethal scorer and reliable shooter = KD all day and everyday. The all-around skills that make teammates better? That would be LeBron.

Blah! They have Phillip Rivers. Good luck.

Wouldn‚Äôt waste my time. I win enough every weekday morning.

Nothing. Because you‚Äôre not getting one.

Wrong. Advertisers and sponsors pay the bills. You‚Äôre thinking of actual work. I‚Äôm thinking of marketability.

Strawberry or French Vanilla.

Thank You.

I agree :-)

The same advice you saw me give earlier.

Of course they do.

Doubt it.

Never. I‚Äôd never do a burner account nor associate myself with one.

Actually, I‚Äôm not. I could talk for hours non-stop right now. And you know it. Nice try though.

Don‚Äôt be an idiot. I‚Äôm not encouraging anyone to do Weed or anything like that. I was saying, right now is not the time to play I around decrying weed smoking. There are bigger fish to fry.

Best of 3 in First round. Best of 5 the rest of the way.

Why? That‚Äôs one less job folks will have. Let him be where he is and me be where I am. That‚Äôs two networks we‚Äôre at instead of one. Stop thinking small.

That‚Äôs an ignorant statement. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone to go back to work NOW. I said eventually, we will. And guess what: I‚Äôll be one of them. I haven‚Äôt taken a day off, and wouldn‚Äôt have even if I had to go to Bristol. You‚Äôre coming at the wrong person. I mean what the Hell I say.

Thank you. Focus on doing the work. Remember, I was a journalist for 20 years before doing this. I‚Äôm not just spouting opinions. I put in the work FIRST.....to earn the right to do it. A lot of folks think they can get away without doing that. They are wrong.

Not something I‚Äôd say at this moment in time, bro. The way things are going, I can‚Äôt blame anyone for anything LEGAL they do right now

Thank You

Nah bro. That ain‚Äôt happening. At least not if everyone has been taking care of themselves and folks come back on the same level.

What up?

What up brother.

Yes sir.

Haaaaaa

Thanks bro.

Not as badly as me.

I‚Äôll be speaking at a few places in the coming months

Yo

Nope. Don‚Äôt know him at all. And btw.....it ain‚Äôt name-dropping if it‚Äôs true.

Haaaa. I remember. Works for me.

That man @HowardStern is special. He‚Äôs paved the way for so many of us, myself included. I‚Äôm grateful. Lesson: Don‚Äôt COMPETE with pioneers. Respect and revere them. And strive to live up to the standard they‚Äôve set.....while never failing to acknowledge their greatness.

Love all of y‚Äôall back. Appreciate the support. Stay Safe. We‚Äôll all get through this.

You know it, bro.

We‚Äôre about to find out, because the @Bucs damn sure have some weapons in Evans, Godwin, Howard and Brate. We shall see. I believe in Tom.

Get the hell over it. What are you proposing? Folks staying out of work for months at a time, not being able to pay their bills, their quality of life deteriorating? We know that at some point, no matter the circumstances, folks are going to take a chance rather than stay home.

I said 2 with his wife. His life is not any of our business. Fall back. Don‚Äôt you have bigger things to be concerned about right now?

He‚Äôs the man. @HowardStern is phenomenal. But just because someone is greater doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not great. You wanna hate? You‚Äôve got to come better than that, bro. You wouldn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing if you weren‚Äôt watching. Remember that. And btw...stay safe out here.

Agreed.

Prayers up my brother @ChrisCuomo. Sincerely hoping and praying for a full and speedy recovery to you ‚Äî and everyone ‚Äî suffering from this virus right now. Stay Strong. Keep being you, sir!

Yes this is true

RT @espn : "These are the heroes we need."

This should be all of our mindset right now. #NewProfilePic

I had to call for an ISO after my man @realjaywilliams said that he thinks Phil Jackson was more important to MJ's success than SCOTTIE PIPPEN was! BLASPHEMOUS!

EVIDENTLY, my own PSA was NECESSARY!

It's difficult for me to defend a quarterback who could have Damn-near won the defensive player of the year for all of his INTs!

KAWHI is the closest thing in Sports today to Michael Jordan!!! Here's why

The @Panthers absolutely screwed over Cam Newton. Somebody had to say it!

Y‚Äôall keep me INSPIRED each and every day! Thank YOU for being YOU.

The decision to suspend the Olympics should have been made AT LEAST a week ago. By delaying the decision, the IOC potentially put many more people in harms way!

RT @FirstTake : "Everybody's acting like you could just punch in somebody [to the Patriots' offense] and they're going to do what Tom Brady has done. That is insulting and disrespectful."

Baby Stephen A was ANNOYED as hell today.

Blame may not be the right word, but if you want to point that finger at someone for the split up between Brady/Belichick, we should all know where that goes:

Wash your nasty hands, DAMNIT!

What‚Äôs up y‚Äôall. Lots to talk about. Sure folks got a few questions. Can‚Äôt always talk to you directly on @FirstTake weekday mornings, but I‚Äôm working on that. For now, it‚Äôs just me. Here I am:

Alright folks!! I will be live in 10 minutes taking questions. See you soon.

Due to technical difficulties, this has been pushed to tomorrow.. sorry peeps!!!!

Hey folks.. I‚Äôll be going live on Twitter today and will be answering some of your questions!! Send me what you got.

Today I'M the host DAMNIT....due to technical difficulties for @MollyQerim. But only for the first hour of @FirstTake

Aaaaa Haaaaaaaaa! Love it! Just for today, though. Not everyday!

Wishing you all the best coach @SeanPayton and a speedy and healthy recovery sir.#GodBless

Dropping another episode of Baby Stephen A

Did y‚Äôall hear what @michaelirvin88 just said to @Espngreeny on @GetUpESPN: that @HoustonTexans coach Bill O‚ÄôBrien actually called @DeAndreHopkins into his office and mentioned the late Aaron Hernandez in the same breath as D-Hop?? Oh! I‚Äôm really done with O‚ÄôBrien if that‚Äôs true.

My Goodness, @Espngreeny. You‚Äôve got both @michaelirvin88 AND @mspears96 ‚Äî two former @dallascowboys ‚Äî on @GetUpESPN at the SAME TIME? Why on earth would you mess up your show, like this?üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÉ. Especially with the Playmaker‚Äôs hairdo like that!üòÄ

Franchise Tag @dak. Not your starting QB. Not when you ask of him what most don‚Äôt get asked. The @dallascowboys should be ashamed of themselves. YOU @danorlovsky7 should be ashamed of yourself....talking all this noise about a FAIR offer. I‚Äôll @GetUpESPN & deal w/ U later!

Hell No I‚Äôm NOT wrong @danorlovsky7. That man @dak is worth what the market allows. I‚Äôm not saying the man is worth $40 mil, but he‚Äôs certainly worth a long-term deal that‚Äôs equal to @cj_wentz and you know it. @GetUpESPN Orlovsky. You know better. You do not franchise that man &

Why are we letting MLB off the hook right now?! CANCEL SPRING TRAINING! This was my position in the 11am hour this morning

The 5 best teams in the NBA right now, in ORDER!

He‚Äôs telling you the absolute truth. It doesn‚Äôt get much better than Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt get any better than @ARBernard in my eyes.

Let me put all of this noise about @KingJames to rest.

As far as I'm concerned, these are who should be the three candidates to be the next @BrooklynNETS head coach.

RT @GetUpESPN : Is LeBron the most valuable player in the NBA?

That‚Äôs what the F$@$ I‚Äôm talking about @KingJames. Going right at Kawhi and the @LAClippers. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take for y‚Äôall to beat these brothers. That‚Äôs all I was trying to say. Now.....officially......the season is every bit as interesting as it‚Äôs supposed 2 be.#HellYea

You want to close out this week right? Then make sure to catch your boy ‚Äî Toure‚Äôs truly ‚Äî Co-Hosting the 6pm EST @SportsCenter at the top of the hour with @GetUpESPN‚Äôs very own @LauraRutledge. We had a blast doing it together yesterday. Now it‚Äôs time to close the week out right!

Excited to be part of this @DickieV

I received THIS message from someone in D-Wade's camp about Spike Lee:

RT @FirstTake : "No other owner in basketball would have issued that statement yesterday. Nobody."

Who did it better?

Haaaaaa! Y‚Äôall are hilarious. Love you guys. Keep up the great work. But stop pouting about my screaming about the @celtics. I love their Big-3 (Kemba, Jalen and JT) but I don‚Äôt think they have enough depth.

Spike Lee told us this today.

Ya gotta play Devil‚Äôs Advocate with Spike Lee........regardless of how RIGHT he is!!!

Spike Lee‚Äôs opening remarks on @FirstTake about last night!

RT @FirstTake : "I'm being harassed by James Dolan and I don't know why."

It is utterly ridiculous that James DOLAN and his @nyknicks are in the news over this. I can‚Äôt believe this S&$@! Why on earth would you give Spike Lee ‚Äî the No.1 supporter ‚Äî this trouble? Well, we‚Äôre about to find out. He‚Äôll be on @FirstTake at the top of the hour (11am EST)

Being at HBCU Week last year was a humbling experience, and I'm thrilled @FirstTake will be returning in 2020.

I didn't know I was spending @GetUpESPN this morning with Mr. T!

I think at this moment in time, if there‚Äôs a team in the East the @Bucks should be concerned about, my pick would be the @Heat

It's not about wins and losses, it's about what you're WITNESSING with the Clippers. That's what people out there don't realize and it gets on my DAMN NERVES!

But if you‚Äôre the @BronzeBomber, you can‚Äôt publicize that. If he beat up someone and they blamed it on the uniform, he‚Äôd have laughed the@ out of the state. Now folks are gonna clown him. Just wish he hadn‚Äôt said that. But I do believe he‚Äôll be back Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd take the

What in the HELL is this? I‚Äôm watching the @sixers...trailing the @MiamiHEAT by 35 Damn points. What they hell did they do....party with the @Chiefs after the damn Super Bowl? Brett Brown running this @spurs system. Tim Duncan & Tony Parker ain‚Äôt walking thru that door? Damn!

yes.

Probably so.

He‚Äôll win at least two more Super Bowls in his career.

I listen to me, bro. I‚Äôm the professor here. Y‚Äôall are the students :-)

Derrick Rose.

Not always, but most of the time.

Problem? You know better.

I‚Äôm a baaaaaaaaaadddddddddddd man :-)

haaaaa.

I‚Äôm about to block you from my page :-)

What up!!!

He was the play-caller.

Nope. Consistent with what I‚Äôve felt about him all along.

Yep. For now.

Nope. Matt Ryan had been in the league for nine or ten years. He had to clout to audible and ignore Shanahan.

Haaaaa. Maybe!:-) Only Kidding.

Actually, I picked the Patriots last year, the Eagles the year before and the Patriots the year before that.#Facts. However, my NBA predictions have been highly suspect in ‚Äî only for the Finals, though ‚Äî in recent memory :-)

It was a big play and a bad one by Sherman. But that was the only one.

I‚Äôm going to refrain from saying that so much out of respect and love to my boys, Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson (‚ÄúAll The Smoke.). Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôll still say it on occasion when appropriate. But my boys educated me a little on this issue.

She deserves the love.

No. Damn good? Yes! But I can‚Äôt say ‚Äúelite‚Äù when you put forth a choke job like that.

Bruno Mars. Never get tired of seeing him perform.

Correct.

Shanahan was the primary play caller in both of his Super Bowls. We heard all week long about him and his Daddy...the brilliant 2-time SB Champion coach. And in the 4th QT of two SB‚Äôs, the man has been out scored 40-0. Seven offensive possessions and not ONE SINGLE POINT.

Awful

That‚Äôs B.S. Often times we‚Äôre blaming players. Rarely do we say the coach.

It was actually pretty good. But.....as I predicted......it wasn‚Äôt better than Beyonc√© with Bruno Mars.

B.S. They should be champions today. Period.

Yes Maam.

I don‚Äôt blame you, bro.

Amen.

Hell Yes!!!

Kyle Shanahan blew this damn Super Bowl. Period!!!!

I‚Äôm sorry........Kyle SHANAHAN has been outscored 52-0 since the 3rd QT of Super Bowl in 2016

In the end, Jimmy G couldn‚Äôt get it done. But the real culprit here is Kyle SHANAHAN. From being the Off. Coordinator with a 28-3 lead in 2016, then the head coach for this Super Bowl, he went away from the run & has been outscored 46-0 in both 4th QT‚Äôs & OT.#Facts

Happy for my man, Coach Andy Reid. Congratulations!

It‚Äôs over

2nd down......Jimmy G nearly gets picked. 3rd down.......misses wide open receiver on the fly. Jimmy G couldn‚Äôt get it done. Plain & Simple

Here‚Äôs the other thing, too: Kyle SHANAHAN going away from the run. Jimmy G was looking good in play action. Damn good. But the @49ers were at their best when they were beating up SF with the run. Then they stopped.

Looks like @Chiefs are about to score. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs interesting now: Jimmy G looked damn-near concussed on the hit over the last possession. Now he‚Äôll have to drive them down for a TD to win it. Hold onto your seats.

Ok! That was a clear P.I., leading to a @tkelce TD on the next play. Now it‚Äôs 20-17. It‚Äôs coming down to the wire. If Jimmy G drives them down the field and they score, he wins MVP. If he doesn‚Äôt and @PatrickMahomes brings @Chiefs back, the @cheetah wins the MVP.#Simple

Oh! Oh! Oh! Another interception by @PatrickMahomes., who through it behind the receiver. Big time play. Still believe him though. He can come back if @49ers can‚Äôt score. This is the game right here. @Chiefs have to stop @49ers right now.

Damn good pass by Jimmy G to Bourne right there. Last few passes Jimmy G is looking special. Whoa! This is looking special right now. Buckle up folks. We all know @PatrickMahomes is not going away.

Whoa! @PatrickMahomes with the bad interception. @49ers amping up the pressure. Plus, now Jimmy G is throwing the football more. Things are getting very interesting.

Damn. Gotta give credit where it‚Äôs due.  That was one hekluva pass from Jimmy G to Kittle. Got called back for off p.i., but damnit it was still a good throw. Okay. We‚Äôve got ourselves a game.

That‚Äôs what the F&@$ you do. You run the ball down the @Chiefs damn throat, then ‚Äî with the box loaded ‚Äî you allow Jimmy G to throw ONLY short-yardage passes and get your pets. You get physical. You turn this into a man‚Äôs game. That‚Äôs what the hell you do.#Damnit

Lots of running by the @49ers right now. Yeah, they can run. But the biggest reason is they don‚Äôt want Jimmy G throwing. He‚Äôs gonna have to show up. Plain and simple.

This is impressive stuff. @Chiefs are running the damn ball, showing no fear, going for 4th & 1. You know why? Because what‚Äôs the risk? Jimmy G.....that‚Äôs what?

Unreal. Jimmy G literally closed his damn eyes and threw the ball up in the air.

You see. It‚Äôs that B.S. right there why I hesitated to pick @49ers. What I‚Äôm the hell was Jimmy G doing with that pass! I mean....WTH! Why throw that damn pass?

It‚Äôs about that time: my Super Bowl Prediction:

Oh, btw......I‚Äôve got to say this: @RealDealBeal23 should most definitely be an all-star. I know the @WashWizards might end up with the worst defense of the modern era, but Beal is special. And his numbers are there. It IS disrespectful to not have him on the EAST.#Ridiculous

Thank you

Oh. I have to say this: the @PelicansNBA looked formidable with @Zionwilliamson on the floor, but the dunk of the night was that tomahawk slam off the alley-oop by @JaMorant. Both of these young brothers are special. I‚Äôm loving what I‚Äôm seeing from both of them.

Thank you. As @KattWilliams would say, Let The Haters Hate. If you don‚Äôt have more of them, somethings wrong.‚Äù

Amen. A leastfir a few more minutes.

I love it. But can‚Äôt be a hypocrite. I‚Äôve always said Michael JORDAN should be the silhouette

Yep! They don‚Äôt want me to pull out the baby face filter, bro. They don‚Äôt want me to do that üòÄüòÄüòÄ

I swear.......this damn blasphemy by @damienwoody cannot be tolerated. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do to this man if he utters this nonsense again :-)

Thank You

Haaaaaaaa. You got me on a few of these. But I did pick the @Patriots last year and the @Eagles the year before. Just saying :-)

Ignorant statement. Opinions are exactly that: opinions. They‚Äôre subjectivity. I‚Äôm acknowledging you have one w/o thinking you should be banned from Twitter. Grow the hell up. Just because someone disagrees doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt say what I feel. Especially on ESPN.

I agree. To me, KC is definitely scoring over 30. But do you really believe in the @Chiefs defense?

Thank you

Not now that the @Lakers finally played their first game since KOBE passed. The rest of this season will be dedicated to him, but folks will definitely lock in on the SB this weekend

What if he pulls off a Strahan, treating MaHomes like he was Brady?

Haaaaaa!!!     This is hilarious.

That‚Äôs a low blow to Ariel. Why can‚Äôt he just feel the way he feels.

You just did bro. Thank you.

Don‚Äôt do that to my man Steve Harvey. I‚Äôm proud the @Browns hires a young brother as their GM, but there‚Äôs no way in hell theyre winning a SB in two years.

Glad y‚Äôall loved this. I know I did. I left out a few plays, too. Could‚Äôve done 10 more had time permitted.

Thank you bro

Same as you. I comment about what I want, when I want, to whom I please.....depending on my mood to do so. Don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs someone with 5 followers or 5 millions. Know one is bigger or smaller than the other. We‚Äôre all human. That‚Äôs just real.

That‚Äôs BS. The question was ‚Äúwhat would Kobe want moving forward. @JalenRose alluded to a title for the @Lakers and I piggybacked off that. It isn‚Äôt foreign knowledge. Everyone knows that. The @Lakers know it. So does @KingJames. Deal with it. Go for it. That‚Äôs all!

I said a few things. If folks want to focus on that, that‚Äôs their problem.

Ok. But I was only talking about what happened with McGregor vs Cowboy

Yes! @NBA Countdown Is on ESPN2 right now for the next hour.

I've been following the fight game since I was three years old. UFC is the latest, and I love it:

My closing comments on Kobe from my NBA Show.

It was a pleasure to join @arielhelwani on his podcast to talk MMA!

Another ‚ÄúOh! No You Didn‚Äôt‚Äù segment.....dedicated to my man @KobeBryant

My @SportsCenter comes on at 7p EST. Tune in for a special edition live from Miami.

@TheNotoriousMMA @SandhuMMA @joerogan Tremendous respect for you @TheNotoriousMMA, along with @joerogan. Both of you are fantastic for the @UFC. I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it nearly as much without the both of you. I wish you both prosperity in the future. But we clearly disagree about Cowboy‚Äôs performance on Jan.18.#RESPECT

@TheNotoriousMMA @SandhuMMA @joerogan that. But to know how tough Cowboy is, lots of fans like myself expected more and I don‚Äôt think @joerogan is right to question my knowledge about a fight just because I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with what I saw. I said what I said and I meant it. It‚Äôs possible to do that and still have...

@TheNotoriousMMA @SandhuMMA @joerogan say that more than 40-seconds was expected from as tough of an SOB as he is, @TheNotoriousMMA. Nor do I think it‚Äôs wrong to assume that there‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs 40-second fight would take place w/ you vs Nurmegamedov or Masvidal. We expected more than what we got. Props to YOU for..

@TheNotoriousMMA @SandhuMMA @joerogan Sir, mich respect to the great @TheNotoriousMMA. My recollection on what I said is ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way it looked.‚Äù Cowboy Cerrone is a perennial top-10 fighter. Much respect to him for the lengthy career he has had. Wishing him nothing but the best. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unfair to..

You're wrong on this one, @joerogan.

@MMAjunkie I‚Äôm busy with family business for the next couple of hours. But I will respond to this BULLSHIT.........TODAY!

@TeddyAtlasReal Will see me very soon. Let everyone have their laughs for now @TeddyAtlasReal. We‚Äôll see who‚Äôs laughing after you get through with me. I‚Äôm coming through Teddy Atlas Gym. At age 52. Stay tuned my man. I‚Äôm coming. You‚Äôll see me real soon.

@TeddyAtlasReal However, there is an upside: the shoulder is getting better due to rehab, and I‚Äôm less that 2 months away from receiving the okay to Box again. And guess who I‚Äôm coming to see to teach me even more?.....YOU @TeddyAtlasReal. You kept offering, so the time has arrived. YOU, sir....

@TeddyAtlasReal My man @TeddyAtlasReal, my apologies for such a shameful display sir. I was not trying to box. This is from nearly 8-months ago ‚Äî AFTER I tore my rotator cuff, and 3 days BEFORE the surgery. I was asked to throw the uppercut that way, and this was posted WITHOUT my permission.

Okay my man. That‚Äôs what I want to hear. I‚Äôll admit, with you, @QuavoStuntin, @_TaylorBennett and @Ronnie2K, I won‚Äôt deny I‚Äôm a bit concerned about the height at my disposal. But y‚Äôall say y‚Äôall are readying do I‚Äôm flowing with y‚Äôall, damnit. Be READY! Be READY! Be READY 2 Ball.

Ok my turn üòÄ

My reaction to Zion's performance

How could you possibly be so cruel as to remind me of this. I‚Äôm officially DEPRESSED about my @nyknicks.....AGAIN!#Damn!!!

Everyone knows @KawhiLeonard is a superstar. But let‚Äôs at least admit this:

Please bro.! That was me 8 months ago AFTER I torn my rotator cuff ‚Äî BUT BEFORE SURGERY....AND....following a damn 90-min workout. But I totally get it. If that was anyone I knew, I‚Äôd rip their ass. Everyone can feel free to get on me about this one. I‚Äôm laughing my damn self:-)

Yes Sir.

@shawnemerriman I wish Bro. Damn I wish. Can someone tell me how to speed up this rotator cuff rehab so I can really start boxing instead of being forced to do slow-ass 1-2 punches? :-)

Congrats BIGTIME @JJWatt. I heard you‚Äôre going to Host @nbcsnl next month. Congrats. Can‚Äôt wait to see it.

I'm here to tell you ... if @TomBrady is really serious about leaving the @Patriots, he needs to sign with the Tennessee Titans.

@EBraeden Awwwwwwww Damn! I DID pick the Chiefs and 49ers to win yesterday, but you got me! You got me! Haaaaaaa

Jesus! This game is over already. I picked the @49ers because they‚Äôre just too gifted for the @packers on both sides of the ball. But I certainly didn‚Äôt expect this. No reason to even continue watching this game any longer. Barring a miracle

Damn! Can‚Äôt express this enough: if I see Ryan Tannenhill in the Super Bowl if @PatrickMahomes I‚Äôm going to very depressed over next two weeks.

Since I‚Äôm here at UFC event tonight, it‚Äôs only right that I make a pick. Grappling/Ground game is to Cowboy‚Äôs advantage. But he‚Äôs been KO‚Äôd 6-times. It will be a 7th unless he takes McGregor into later rounds ‚Äî which I don‚Äôt think will happen. ‚ÄúMcGregor in 2.‚Äù

Oh Yeah! You knew I was gonna be in the house for this. Watch #UFC246 on ESPN+

Major props to you bro @carmeloanthony on your milestone. Much-deserved. Way to ball. Continued success as this season progresses.

Oh Hell Yeah!!!!!!! Y‚Äôall know what time it is. NBA All-Star weekend is almost upon us. Time to get #TeamSAS right ‚Äî because I‚Äôm NOT losing, Damnit. Here is who‚Äôs gonna be the CAPTAIN of my team: ‚Å¶@chancetherapper‚Å©.#Aaaahhhhhhj!!!

I‚Äôm not shilling for a paycheck here. @BadBoys is a movie close to my heart. So glad Will Smith and @RealMartyMar are back! Can‚Äôt wait for #BadBoysForLife in theaters now! #ad

Will you stop it @SethOnHoops. Come on! Are the @HoustonRockets same team w/o @JHarden13? What are the @LAClippers w/o Kawhi or PG? What you said about the @Lakers w/o @KingJames or @AntDavis23 can be said about any team. @GetUpESPN coach. Get‚Äôem @RealJayWilliams

Alex Cora. should be ashamed of himself! He‚Äôs so much better than this as a baseball guy!

Wait a minute Lil Rel! Can you PLAY? Can you SHOOT? DRIBBLE? PASS? I saw no evidence of these things in "Uncle Drew!" Let me ask my man, @KevinHart4real! I'm serious y'all: No scrubs allowed on my team. I want video evidence. You too, Lil Rel! VIDEO EVIDENCE! Get back at me!

Look, @KevinHart4real turns out I may need your help after all. Not to play though ‚Äî damn sure not to do that. I‚Äôve got too many cats trying to get on my squad. I need a SCOUT that‚Äôs seen some of these guys to let me know if they can play? You down bro? Can ya help a brother?

It very rarely happens, but I've been silenced, DAMNIT! üôÑNo way around it (Haaaaa!)

That pass interference call was initiated by the defense. Should‚Äôve been a Clemson TD. But at this point, it really doesn‚Äôt matter.

Damn! Y‚Äôall got me @Realrclark25 & @mspears96. Y‚Äôall got me. Tried to go against y‚Äôall. It‚Äôs @LSUfootball‚Äôa year!

Get Etienne the ball. Period. No trickery. Your WR‚Äôs are not getting open Dabo. Just get him the damn ball.

I‚Äôm not impressed with Lawrence in this game. I‚Äôve counted 10 overthrows. 10......at the site of pressure. I thought he was a college superstar. Not ELI Manning.#WTH

I absolutely, positively, do not understand this. @ClemsonFB has been successful giving Etienne the ball. Why not feed this man.

What B.S. To get thrown out of the game for hit is utterly ridiculous. Penalty? Fine. But to get thrown out of the damn game? Just F&@$& Ridiculous!

@GetUpESPN Uh huh! Uh huh! I see y‚Äôall. I see y‚Äôall. Don‚Äôt hide tonight. Don‚Äôt hide.

@GetUpESPN @Realrclark25 @mspears96 Oooohhhhhhh!!!!! I can‚Äôt wait to see these boys tomorrow morning. They have dug @LSUfootball a HOLE. Yeah @mspears96! Yeah Ryan Clark! Don‚Äôt hide tonight. Don‚Äôt hide.

I made this announcement today about my career people:

@GW_MBB @A10MBB @battletime510 Proud of this young brother.

It's time to pick CLEMSON! I'm picking them to win tonight!!!!

I‚Äôll still be around contributing a lot ‚Äî and there will be a @FirstTake presence ‚Äî but this will be my last week officially hosting the Stephen A. Smith Show on @ESPNRadio. Some come holla at me all week long 1-3pm EST. We start roaring in less than 10 min.#LetsGo

RT @FirstTake : What‚Äôs up, New Orleans üôåüôåüôå

BTW.......the @HoustonTexans have given up. They know it's over. You can see it all in their body language. They know they can't stop @PatrickMahomes

Okay. Maybe, just maybe, we'll have a game here.......IF......the @HoustonTexans can manage to find a way to stop @PatrickMahomes and @Chiefs' offense. I mean....Damn! 6-straight touchdowns. Bill O'Brien! Romeo Crennel. Can we get some defense. Please, w/ Sugar on top!

Props to @DeAndreHopkins for being out there with cracked ribs. But do the @HoustonTexans have any other receivers. Because if they do, we certainly haven't seen them. At least not before this last pass to Kenny Stills

Just a pure absence of intelligence or pure panic. Why would you need to HOLD @tkelce when you already have 2 guys on him. And btw...what are we to think of Bill O'Brien now? or @deshaunwatson, for that matter? 41-unanswered points? NOBODY can stop the bleeding? Damn! Come On!

We are watching the @warriors of the @NFL with these @Chiefs, man. This is unreal to witness. In 1 1/2 quarters, they look surreal and unstoppable on offense. Down 24-0, they're about to have scored 41-unanswered points inside of 20 minutes or so. Just unreal.

I totally believe in @deshaunwatson. What I don't believe in is that offensive line assigned to protect him. In my opinion, there's no way in hell the @HoustonTexans OL will ward off that defensive line of the @49ers. Can't see it. Don't believe it for one second.

Not only have the @Chiefs scored 34-unanswered points (5 TD's in a row), but their last TD, on the opening drive of the 2nd half, was scored without @tkelce (Hamstring) on the field. This is the kind of threat we need to see in the Super Bowl.#LetUsPray

This is just unreal. All of us -- and I do mean ALL OF US -- who care about having a sensational Super Bowl, should be rooting heavily for @PatrickMahomes and the @Chiefs to get to the Super Bowl. I've now gotten to the point where I believe that's all that can stop the @49ers.

Rib injury to @DeAndreHopkins. Things are getting worse for the @HoustonTexans

Wanted to take a moment to congratulate new @Browns head coach, Kevin Stefanski.. At least he was a COORDINATOR. So let's see: @dallascowboys, @Giants @Redskins @Panthers and now the @Browns all have new coaches. Not one single BLACK MAN gets the nod.#SteppingBackward.

Big FG miss. But the real major thing is @PatrickMahomes, who really showed you the difference between a "running QB" and a "Big-Time QB who just so happens to know how to run. Meaning no disrespect to anyone, but there's a difference w/ Mahomes and @Lj_era8 Saturday & Sunday.

Great call by Bill O'Brien to stay aggressive. Great pass from Watson to Hopkins. A FG here will go a long way for salvaging some things for the @HoustonTexans here. Let's see what they do.

And there we go. Another TD by Kelce. Love Tony Romo and the job he does, but there's no debate for me here. That's a damn touchdown. What an amazing comeback. Now I need @deshaunwatson up off the bench, warming up, knowing he'll need to fling that football. It's on right now.

This is absolutely, positively unreal. The @Chiefs, down 24-0 in the first QT, is about the take the lead.

What the hell is going on?!?! 3 TDs in 3 minutes??? This is sensational. This is what playoff football is all about!

Awwwwww S$&@! The @Titans are about to ruin everything for us, meaning @Ravens vs. @Chiefs, Jackson vs. MaHomes. After Tannenhill just threw that bomb to put Tennessee up 14-0.  @Ravens are in trouble.

My Girl JJ continues to shine. In the decade I‚Äôve known her, she‚Äôs now had Not 1 Not 2....but 3 NY Times Bestsellers. So proud of her/her team. Keep grinding Ms. Smith. Keep inspiring us. I lapsed a little bit, but now I‚Äôm getting back on plan. Congratulations! Go get this book.

Hey @realmartymar, Will Smith, cast me in @BadBoys you cowards! #BadBoysForLife 1.17.20 #ad

This is how it all started at ESPN.

@KendrickPerkins Fair enough @KendrickPerkins. Wasn‚Äôt implying that at all. Was just highlighting how things are perceived when you talk of someone you shared a locker room with. Nothing more. But do you bro. Appreciate the clarification.#Respect

Please, please, please reconsider @KevinHart4real. I need you bro. WTH am I gonna do without those 3pts, 1assists and ZERO rebounds per game. Come on man, PLEASE :-)

My takeaways from the KD/Perk Twitter exchange:

Guess who is coaching in the All-Star Celebrity Game!!!! üòÄüòÄüòÄ

I have absolutely no problem with @KDTrey5 clapping back on Twitter.

‚ÄúOh, No You Didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Here‚Äôs my latest version

It‚Äôs about that time AGAIN

Of course I didn‚Äôt speak to Kawhi. Who does? But I‚Äôll tell you, I DID hear he said THIS about @KingJames guarding him. And if this is true, that‚Äôs even more of a reason to pray for a @Lakers vs @Clippers Conference Finals this May.

I don‚Äôt know about the rest of y‚Äôall who want to get in better shape, but I‚Äôm about to try this.

coach was black. That was the point. I‚Äôm quite sure there are legitimate head-coaching candidates who are positional coaches. The real issue is the issue of fairness NOT being accorded to black coaches. No knock on the Joe Judge‚Äôs of the world whatsoever. Be well, my brother.

Thanks for watching @FirstTake. Much appreciated. But the segment wasn‚Äôt about going off over the fact that he‚Äôs a WR Coach. It was about the fact that countless Black folks are being passed over, and the latest was for a positional coach ‚Äî which would‚Äôve NEVER happened if that..

I don‚Äôt want to hear a damn thing else about the Rooney Rule. Not after this hire by the NY Giants

@kevinchupka Howdy, Sir. HOWDO!!!! Appreciate the love very much. Happy New Year to you and yours

All my Cowboys players, where is the best place to sit for the playoffs?

Commissioner Stern was no-nonsense. He simply did not play at all. But he was straight-up, he was brilliant, and an incredible friend to those he loved, supported and respected. MJ said it best: the @NBA wouldn‚Äôt be where it is today were it not for him.#R.I.P.Commish!

Just arrived back in town for the New year and found out about the passing of former @NBA Commissioner, David Stern. A devastating loss for the entire basketball world. The man was a leader, an innovator and the architect of the global, iconic brand we marvel over today.

Pat Shurmur never should have been hired to begin with!

Terrible....Terrible news for @dallascowboys‚Äô fans everywhere: I was SUPPOSE to be off from @FirstTake tomorrow morning. But I think I‚Äôm gonna change my mind just this one day. So I WILL see you all on @FirstTake in the AM.#HOWDOOOO!!!

Southern Stevie reckons you might like this. Thanks, @MorningSportsWd.

Damnit @saquon!!!!!!

Congrats on a damn good career my brother @MacBo50. All the best to you.

Whoa! Did y‚Äôall see that! Trevor Lawrence with a 67-Yard TD run. Okay. Okay. That run is going to make him some $$$

Now that is just damn ridiculous. Yes, the kid Wade for @OhioStateFB did connect with Lawrence‚Äô helmet. But that was NOT targeting. No way he should‚Äôve been ejected for that plan. The QB lowered his head. That is just an awful call.#AWFUL

Okay! Okay. With @OhioStateFB up 10-0 after Dobbins 68-Yard TD run, we‚Äôre about to find out who @ClemsonFB is. Whatcha gonna do???? Let‚Äôs find out

I don‚Äôt want to hear another damn word bout Lincoln Riley and the @dallascowboys. And I don‚Äôt care if it IS college. You can‚Äôt give up 49 points in a HALF and deserve a promotion to the NFL Level. I don‚Äôt want to hear it.

@clipperdarrell @LAClippers @FirstTake I‚Äôm not giving up on the @Lakers et @CedEntertainer ‚Äî Damn, I mean @clipperdarrell (Haaaa). But I‚Äôm not gonna front: the @LAClippers ain‚Äôt worried about the @Lakers at all. The LakeShow is gonna have figure that out. And it starts with @KingJames . Again, we shall see.

@clipperdarrell @LAClippers @FirstTake Damn! I didn‚Äôt know @CedEntertainer - I mean, @clipperdarrell (Haaaa) ‚Äî would come at me like that. But it‚Äôs all love bro. Y‚Äôall deserve this. I can‚Äôt explain how something is always going wrong with @KingJames whenever Kawhi is on the court vs him but we‚Äôll see. We Shall See bro

First of all @damienwoody, you sit UP when you‚Äôre sitting in MY seat on @FirstTakex you show up with a TIE. And you diversify your wardrobe instead of wearing that same blue suit. As for you @TheRachLindsay, keep up the great work. You too, @D19J. WOODY, RESPECT UR ELDERSüòÄüòÄüòÄ

I believe @drewbrees has had a better career than Peyton Manning.

The @76ers championship aspirations are riding on this man

There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd be sitting here today if it weren‚Äôt for @alleniverson.

Today's mood.

Not quite sure how @RealSkipBayless‚Äô wife does it and her new book attempts to explain it! üòÄüòÄ Check it out here, people.

I think the Giants are lying.

My thoughts and prayers are with David Stern.

Barkley and @Shaq were correct. So im@not breaking news here

1) I have a name. 2) It‚Äôs your colleague & friend....whose known you for YEARS! 3) What I‚Äôve said on many occasions on @FirstTake & ESPN Radio: that I was behind the scenes speaking to ppl in support of getting Kaepernick back into NFL. So what‚Äôs the problem now? Happy Holidays!

Great chatting with my boys @Matt_Barnes22 and @DaTrillStak5 on @SHOsports. Watch the full podcast here!

RT @FirstTake : "I would never trust him in life again."

RT @SHOsports : The always-honest @stephenasmith drops by #AllTheSmoke TOMORROW on YouTube & podcast platforms:

Why I feel like I've never arrived.

I‚Äôve been telling @KobeBryant ‚Äî and his two-time-@GQMagazine Cover self ‚Äî for YEARS that I‚Äôm coming. This is a start.

My top 5 most ANNOYING people in all of sports... don't miss #1 :)

The person I blame most for the Knicks üòÑ

Haaaaaa! Yes Sir. You‚Äôre the Boss!

Yo! Jimmy G was BIGTIME.........Yesterday!!!!!!

I DON'T WANT NO DAMN HUG @RealJayWilliams !!!

Me and the boys!!! Pleasure to join their new podcast @Matt_Barnes22 @DaTrillStak5

Damn Spotify knows me too well.

Oh, well. Another Cowboys loss.

Accident waiting to happen ü§£ü§£ü§£

Its only halftime but uh-oh...... ü§£ü§£ü§£

Throwback to the 2004 NBA Finals! #TBT

This @GetUpESPN crew needs to get it together.

Stuart Scott was one of the best people I've ever known. This V Week, honor his legacy and donate to his fund.

Just because there's no @SportsCenter with Stephen A this week doesn't mean we can't have a #NoYouDidnt üòÄüòÄüòÄ

I‚Äôll never forget where I came from.

RT @FirstTake : Carson Wentz is asked to do more than Nick Foles ever was, according to @stephenasmith.

BLASPHEMY out of the mouth of @finebaum on @GetUpESPN this morning about Nick Saban. Absolute Blasphemy

It ain't Tom Brady's fault.

Right now Baker Mayfield has more COMMERCIALS than WINS. That's just the truth!

What a disgraceful loss by the @Eagles. You‚Äôre up 28-14 and give up 23-unanswered points to the @MiamiDolphins ‚Äî who‚Äôs coach, Brian Flores is doing a damn good job, btw ‚Äî but that isn‚Äôt the point. The point is the @Eagles just Gabe the division to the @dallascowboys#MerryXMas

It‚Äôs officially over now, after that TD. @OhioStateFB now up 49-27. No Urban Myer beating up on Harbaugh this time. Now it‚Äôs Ryan Day. Message to @UMichFootball folks: there is no rivalry with you‚Äôre 0-5 in the Harbaugh era. Turned channel to @AlabamaFTBL vs @AuburnFootball

What an awful call on 4th down by @UMichFootball, especially since you‚Äôve been getting zero push from the off. Line practically all afternoon long. Now @OhioStateFB has a 1st down on UM‚Äôs 28-yard line. As if we didn‚Äôt already know they were going to lose this game.......

Okay @youngwhiteside. 10 blocks tonight. I see that. That‚Äôs the type of S@&@ we‚Äôre suppose to see most nights. But I‚Äôm really proud of what I‚Äôm seeing from my man @carmeloanthony. Just dropped 23 & 11 tonight. @trailblazers have won 3-straight. Loving this right now.

RT @espn : One year later ...

There‚Äôs no denying this: the @49ers are great. But Jimmy G? That remains to be seen

I sincerely hope y‚Äôall Thanksgiving was as good as mineüòÄüòÄüòÄ

I‚Äôm so DAMN thankful for the COWBOYS ü§£ü§£ü§£

Yo! While I‚Äôm tempted to laugh at what‚Äôs happening to the @dallascowboys right now, seeing Jerry Jones suite empty right now tells me xactky what I‚Äôm suspecting: Jason Garrett may get FIRED tonight ‚Äî or tomorrow morning. The team responding like this after Jerry‚Äôs words?#Damn!

RT @FirstTake : Settle this: What's the best Thanksgiving food?

Here's what I told Carmelo Anthony when he landed in Portland.

RT @FirstTake : With all due respect to Alabama right now ...

I‚Äôm 52 years old with a torn rotator cuff and a knee problem that has spanned 3 decades and I could have scored as many points as Joel Embiid!!!!!

No, Lamar Jackson is NOT the best quarterback in the NFL.......YET

WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT, @JoelEmbiid?!

Awwwwwww‚Äô my brother @mspears96 seems a bit emotional right now on @GetUpESPN about his @dallascowboys. Awwwwww! Haaaaa! See you on @FirstTake this morning S.W.A.G.U.#Haaaaaaa!!!

Jason Garrett HAS to go!

RT @ARBernard : Lord,

RT @breakfastclubam : Our 3rd annual #Change4Change and in 18 hours we raised over $670,000 for @tmcf_hbcu!!! With all the ratchetness we serve up on this radio show I think we balance it out in times like this!!! Donations are still open through Thanksgiving üó≥ text CHANGE to 52182 and give back!!

RT @ARBernard : It's time to make going to church a habit! #ARBWisdom #church #community #worship

Mason Rudolph is the one who needs to be speaking up about Myles Garrett's accusation.

NO guests for today. The lines are open for the ENTIRE show. NOBODY is hiding!

That was @FirstTake. The Stephen A. Smith Show @ESPNSAS on @ESPNRadio and ESPN News is next. Translation: Ain‚Äôt a damn person hiding this way. 888.SAY.ESPN is the number. I‚Äôll be there at the top of the hour. PLEASE CALL IN. Pretty Please with Sugar on Top.#AtYourOwnPeril!

The man himself @terrellowens ASKED to come on @FirstTake today to cal back at me for things I‚Äôve said this week on @Kaepernick7 and @MylesLGarrett situations. He ASKED, peeps. Not me. I‚Äôm gonna leave it at that.

Here to support today‚Äôs @breakfastclubam radiothon and all the great work they are doing for @tmcf_hbcu! Make sure to donate TODAY. #Change4Change

What a Game this is between the @celtics vs @LAClippers. What a Freakin Game. This is so special to watch.

Here it is... this week's edition of #NoYouDidnt!!!

Yeah! Yeah! You know what time it is in the @NBA tonight

You know what time it is!!! @SportsCenter with Stephen A starts at 7pm EST. DON‚ÄôT MISS IT!

Hey, @KingJames is still the Greatest ‚Äî TODAY! But let me be clear: I'll never take LeBron over MJ and here's why.

RT @iamalquarles : After listening to the @stephenasmith interview on the @karenhunter show (which was fire), I completely understand his take now.

I went on @karenhunter‚Äôs show to discuss whether or not Colin Kaepernick really wants to play. Watch the full damn thing here!

Listen to this, Damnit!

RT @FirstTake : "Because you don't trust the NFL, you use that as an excuse for everything."

This is what needs to be said about the Kaepernick situation.

The fact that Colin Kaepernick didn't show up to his original workout location eradicates his points altogether.

RT @stephenasmith : @E_Reid35 ... The more you talk, the more ridiculous you sound, @E_Reid35:

@E_Reid35 ... The more you talk, the more ridiculous you sound, @E_Reid35:

Excuse the couple of spelling errors. I was driving before pulling off the road

@E_Reid35 why even bother. You‚Äôll never listen. But others will hear @E_Reid35. You can bet the house on that. Just listen. It‚Äôs coming from the multitude of places. And it‚Äôs damn sure ‚Äî like a storm ‚Äî on @FirstTake Monday morning. So buckle the hell up!

@E_Reid35 Chances are.....you won‚Äôt. Because your ears are clogged and you‚Äôre too blinded by vitriol to see when a brother is showing you ‚Äî y‚Äôall ‚Äî love and respect @E_Reid35 by simply letting you know what will work at what won‚Äôt. But oh, I forgot: we all ain‚Äôt S&@$ in your world. So...

@E_Reid35 a damn thing but so much when your hand is out for someone else‚Äôs dime or product. Especially when you haven‚Äôt played in 3 years, when you were 1-10 in your last 11 games as a starter and the top-4 league MVP candidates are all black @E_Reid35. When will you learn?

@E_Reid35 are you ‚Äî yes, you @E_Reid35 ‚Äî going to wake the hell up and realize that maybe, just maybe, the enemy at THIS POINT ain‚Äôt the NFL. It‚Äôs not Malcolm Jenkins, Jay-Z or ME. Maybe the enemy is YOU, your childish tendencies and your unwillingness to accept that you can‚Äôt run.......

@E_Reid35 Hasn‚Äôt acknowledged that? But life isn‚Äôt fair. It damn sure ain‚Äôt ideal. And at some point, you‚Äôve got the grab the opportunity. Kap‚Äôs occurred today. And what does he do: alters the process, and shows up with a T-Shirt alluding to SLAVERY @E_Reid35. For a JOB INTERVIEW! When

@E_Reid35 Huh @E_Reid35? To call our or beat up everyone who utters a word you disagree with? All Brithers, BTW. Let me tell you something Mr. @E_Reid35: Kaepernick has been supported. We‚Äôve all said he was done wrong. That he was blackballed. That he should be in the league. Who the hell

@E_Reid35 Yet attack brothers ‚Äî Malcolm Jenkins, Jay-Z, ME ‚Äî at every turn the second someone disagrees with you. You @E_Reid35 got the nerve to call out the @NFL when your beef was suppose to be with society in regards to police brutality and racial oppression. Where‚Äôs your plan?

@E_Reid35 Man, please. You embarrass yourself @E_Reid35 every single time you open your mouth. You ‚Äî of all people ‚Äî talking of tap dancing when you‚Äôre the one collecting a check from the very institution you collect a check from. You @E_Reid35, who takes a knee ‚Äî supposedlyfor brothers ‚Äî

He doesn't want to play.

‚ÄúIndefinite‚Äù attached to a suspension with the NFL means something, folks: that there‚Äôs more to come.

And btw....neither Pouncey nor DiCastro should be suspended AT ALL. All they did was protect a defenseless teammate ‚Äî who happened to be their damn QUARTERBACK. They shouldn‚Äôt be penalized at all.

Go to @MylesLGarrett page and you‚Äôll see the headline: ‚ÄúA Hero is made by the path he chooses, not by the power he is graced with.‚Äù Yet, he goes and does what he did to Mason Rudolph. This calls for an automatic SEASON-ENDING SUSPENSION. He should be DONE for the rest of the year

I‚Äôm sorry, but can this guy Mason Rudolph at least PRETEND he sees the rush? I mean, these are not blind-side blitz‚Äôs the @Browns are throwing at him. He‚Äôs acting like he can‚Äôt freakin move out the way.#Damn!

This week‚Äôs edition of #NoYouDidnt!!!

Now THIS is totally hilarious. What betrayal on the part of Austin Rivers. And I love it!

He‚Äôs the No.2-overall pick in the draft for a reason

RT @ESPNNBA : .@stephenasmith about to break out the dance moves on set üòÇüï∫

I think it's likely that Colin Kaepernick gets a job in the NFL following his private workout. Assuming........

When we think about @Astros, we use to think about their greatness being contaminated by them having an abuser on their squad. Now, we can add cheating to the list. Damn!

Make sure to tune into my sit down with @JHarden13 during my SportsCenter Special ahead of Clippers vs. Rockets tonight.

Some more information on Kaepernick's workout...

Disney+ has arrived, y'all. The best way to find it is by downloading the Disney Plus App or going to  I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.#LookOutWorld!!!

Look Barry White ‚Äî I mean @mspears96 ‚Äî if you want people to @GetUpESPN, especially if you‚Äôre gonna be ready for ME.....you‚Äôd better get your energy up. Just because your @LSUfootball got LUCKY, doesn‚Äôt mean you get to recline and chill w/ Mr. @Chippendales, I mean @Espngreeny:-)

RT @FirstTake : "Right now, he needs to come out with an insanity plea."

If there was ever a time where I wish I WASN'T restricted by FCC airwaves, it would be RIGHT NOW, DAMNIT!

I‚Äôm now going to be taking fan submissions for this segment. Please tweet me with #NoYouDidnt and I will include the best ones in my show!! üòÄ

I don‚Äôt even know who this @AlabamaFTBL team is. Could not get a single stop that mattered all game long. @LSUfootball rolled into TUSCALOOSA and nearly dropped 50 on the Tide. Embarrassing performance by Bama‚Äôs D! Props to the Tigers. Can‚Äôt say a word!

About damn time Jeudy. That was the 2nd TD pass you dropped, fore making up for it by catching that one. NOW @AlabamaFTBL..whatcha gonna do. Can you get 1-damn-stop and get Tua the ball back with enough time left? Can you do it? It‚Äôs time, damnit!

The @LSUfootball Tigers went into Tuscaloosa and dropped 40!!! I can‚Äôt say a damn word. Because I did not see this coming!

Add dropped touchdown passes to the lost of @AlabamaFTBL mistakes. That was a perfect throw to Jeudy and he flat-out dropped it.#IAmDepressed!

I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm giving it up to @mspears96, @Realrclark25 and @ESPNBooger. What I‚Äôm seeing from @LSUfootball is an ass whupping in @AlabamaFTBL. Bama can‚Äôt stop them and, offensively, Tua & the boys ain‚Äôt doing anything. Too many mistakes, too. Just awful, just like Nat‚Äôl title GM.

This is the 3rd blitz we‚Äôve seen from @LSUfootball where the defender was not even TOUCHED by @AlabamaFTBL‚Äôs offensive line.....having clear shots at Tua. This is not looking good, Damnit!!!

What in the Hell is going on with @AlabamaFTBL right now??? First, a fumble by Tua, messing up a TD. Then a muffed punt. Now an INT called back because of 12-men on the field. Who is this team right now????#Damn!!!!

To my boys @SECNetwork: @TimTebow, @finebaum and @mspears96: ROLLLL TIDDDDEEE!!!!!!

Go ahead afterall and add a 3rd round in the @NBA draft. Just make sure to create a route where kids can finish their education, plus have an insurance policy for potential injuries. Enough with the @NCAA. They just need to go. They make me so sick. Why‚Äôd the kid start the season

It‚Äôs official. The @NCAA is a damn travesty. This kid Wiseman is ineligible ‚Äî after already starting the season ‚Äî because COACH Penny Hardaway is a booster? This is straight B.S. no wonder @KingJames and so many others are so against the NCAA. Hey @NBA, I‚Äôve got an idea:

I agree with the Clippers being fined and here‚Äôs why.

I said it years ago. I say it now. I will forever say this:

RT @usairforce : Happening this morning! @CMSAF18's on @FirstTake!

How y‚Äôall let the Cowboys become ‚ÄúAMERICA‚ÄôS TEAM‚Äù ???

Here we go again on @GetUpESPN. The whole crew, led by @Espngreeny and @LRiddickESPN looking like they‚Äôre auditioning for @Chippendales. Y‚Äôall are something! Haaaaa

I tell people all the time... EVERYBODY has to answer to somebody.

Just when I was about to spread more love on @FirstTake  to my brothers, Dominique Foxworth and @damienwoody, this damn man Woody is sitting in my seat without a TIE. Man.....don‚Äôt make me come through this screen and deal with you. And before you open your mouth, watch ur tone!

To my sisters @Chiney321 and Ros Gold-Onwude, to my brother @RealJayWilliams, fantastic job just now on @FirstTake interviewing @TheTraeYoung. See....it‚Äôs moments like this that brings a tear to this middle-aged man. Look at y‚Äôall making me proud, filling in this way.#üòâüëçüòâ‚úåÔ∏èüòÖ

Introducing my new segment... NO YOU DIDN‚ÄôT!

LEBRON is just getting STARTED.

RT @FirstTake : "[Clemson's ranking] is a travesty."

Yeah, Yeah, @Realrclark25. I see you screaming on @GetUpESPN. You go ahead and do that. It won‚Äôt prevent your kittens ‚Äî I mean ‚ÄúTigers‚Äù ‚Äî from taking this ‚ÄúL.‚Äù You better pray someone kidnaps Tua. If not YOU, SWAGU and @LSUfootball are going DOWN. You like the rhyme,üòâ.#RollTide!

Awwwww Damn!:-)

Anthony Davis leaving the Lakers? PLEASE!

Y'all know what time it is.

Btw........no I did not forget to say Happy Birthday to my brother!

Yes, I UNLEASHED that black cat! I did it, damnitüòÄ

Sometimes, it‚Äôs hard to take this manüòÄ

He @notthefakeSVP, I‚Äôm watching you on @SportsCenter right now. Don‚Äôt let @ESPNBooger and @Realrclark25 to get their hopes up. LSU will fall this weekend. #RollllllllllTIDE!!!!!

Adam Gase is a waste of time and he should be fired.

The GOAT just called me the GOAT. I‚Äôm getting emotional right now about this.

Are any of us @Knicks‚Äô fans really surprised by this???

I'll never forget this insight Denzel Washington gave me years ago.

I always need to get the @GetUpESPN crew in order.

You want to know something about @KyrieIrving, how about this:

My Brother, CONGRATS big boy! Proud of you. Proud of the growth. You‚Äôll shine at this the way you shine at everything you do. Forever your brother-from-another-mother. Keep doing it!

Kevin Durant said the incident with @Money23Green played a part in him leaving Golden State.

It‚Äôs about to happen. @KDTrey5 on @FirstTake!

No matter how Good Will Harris has been for the @astros in the postseason, you must go to Gerrit Cole ‚Äî your damn Ace. You saw the @Nationals go to Corbin, right? That‚Äôs what you do. Hinch overthought a lot in Game 7. And it cost the @astros a title.

Congrats to the @Nationals. Cardiac kids ‚Äî even if they‚Äôre one of the older teams in baseball. Soto is something special. And now that I‚Äôve gotten that out the way, Hinch blew the damn game. You don‚Äôt have Greinke pitching that way and replace him with anyone but Gerrit Cole.

... we‚Äôll get better competition that way.

Not looking for anybody to get hurt. Certainly ain‚Äôt looking forward to two stars getting suspended. But love the combativeness. Can‚Äôt tell y‚Äôall how sick & tired I am of love affairs taking place on the court all the damn time. Give me @russwest44 attitude any day of the week...

@celtics

Damn Right! Momma DURANT is no joke. I ain‚Äôt no fool :-)

Tell me about it

I said no such thing. What I said was is either grab a mic and speak extensively on the issue or shut the hell up. If you‚Äôre gonna quote me, do it accurately

Thanks bro

Thank you so much

Because you‚Äôre too busy paying attention to me than so many other obnoxious folks on TV. So you wouldn‚Äôt know any better

That‚Äôs the dumbest comment of the day. Pierce and I defended @KyrieIrving. What the hell were you listening to??

Yessir the 2nd edition of @SportsCenter with Stephen A. Smith is coming up at 7pm!!!

Yeah! Yeah! It‚Äôs Wednesday, so you know what that means: @SportsCenter with Stephen A. Smith on ESPN at 7pm. It‚Äôs about that time üòÄ

YES, I STOOD by my comments calling it the WEAKEST move ever by a superstar!

I talked sources with @KDTrey5 on the @boardroom, NOW streaming on ESPN+!

Y'all AINT gonna wanna MISS this! üòÄ@boardroom. It‚Äôs about that time. Released tomorrow....on ESPN+

RT @ARBernard : Pessimism and doubt are two of the most important tools that the devil uses to achieve his objectives. Your challenge is to ensure that the devil cannot use these tools on you. #ARBWisdom #FollowGod #challenge #faith

Answer the DAMN question!

RT @FirstTake : "A legitimate argument could be made that the Cleveland Browns don't know how to play football."

Me and @KDTrey5 on the @boardroom this Wednesday on ESPN+!

There he is again. Kyrie Irving.....to the right wing....step back 3 with :21 left to give @BrooklynNets the lead. Damn!

Okay @nyknicks. Okay. I see y‚Äôall. Erased a 19-pt deficit. Wayne Ellington drilling 3-straight 3‚Äôs. Okay! Okay! I‚Äôm loving this. Forcing 25 TO‚Äôs by the @BrooklynNets so far, too. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

On my radio show, @DaTrillStak5 said @KingJames doesn't have that DOG mentality.

If he plays, this isn‚Äôt even a contest:

Thank you bro

Here ya go bro

He‚Äôs getting there........maybe

Thank you bro

Yessir

Thank you

You heard that right, the Sixers have the best starting 5 in the Eastern Conference!

Here we come!!! 7pm @SportsCenter

I‚Äôm about to appear on ‚ÄúTHE JUMP‚Äù with @Rachel__Nichols right now. Buckle up!!!!

I was just emotional this morning on @FirstTake. Wha DDA ya want me to say:

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! My NBA Show debuts TONIGHT. It‚Äôs Time!!!!!!!

Oooohhhhhhh, somebody on @GetUpESPN is in a WORLD of trouble, bringing up my hairline. Okay, Ryan Clarke. OkayüòÄüòÄüòÄ

My NBA MVP prediction is in...

I‚Äôll believe it when I see it.

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith picks his top 5 teams in the NBA (spoiler Alert‚ÄìThe Bucks didn't make the list).

I've been covering the NBA for 25 years. I've NEVER been more excited for a season.

NBA is back!!!!!!

Finally! Finally! Finally!!!!!!!

Hey. I don‚Äôt give a damn if the @Bengals go 0-16. All that means to me is that they didn‚Äôt pick the right man to REPLACE Marvin Lewis. It does not mean Marvin Lewis did not deserve to go!

Why in the hell is Sam Darnold still in this game??? For what Adam Gase? Makes no sense. But then again, it does. It‚Äôs the @nyjets we‚Äôre talking about.

First of all, the @nyjets are awful. Secondly, Sam Darnold has never looked worse. Third, Adam Gaseous is worse than the rest of the team. He‚Äôs gonna get @LeVeonBell killed with his play-calling. He was never the right man for the job. Damn shame @nyjets are on National TV.

Another day, another nauseating Cowboys fan calling into my show.

Love this picture:

This is what I‚Äôve been waiting for.

Yes yes I gotta give credit to the damn @dallascowboys today!

F&$@!!!!!‚Äô Told y‚Äôall...I never believed in Alroldis Chapman. What in the HELL are you getting cute for, throwing back-to-back 84 mph sliders? For what????? They can‚Äôt hit his gas. Chapman got cute, period. Horrible pitching selection. Over in 6...just like I knew it would be.

That called 3rd strike just now vs the @Yankees Brett Gardner was straight B.S. that was not a damn strike. I know the @astros are the better team and it‚Äôs gonna take a miracle to win this, but damn......they don‚Äôt need more help like shit.#BullS&$@

I asked @RobertIger if it's important to be the smartest guy in the room.

The great @RobertIger joined my show to talk about his newest book, "The Ride of a Lifetime."

I think the Pelicans should be very very concerned about Zion's injury.

My condolences to @RealDealBeal23.

How bad do you want it?

Obviously I'm having a very good day

That kind of day

I reckon this brotha @mspears96 could use a hug. ü§†

Major.....Major Thanks for the birthday wishes!!!!

I reckon you Cowboy fans are struggling!

Aaaahhhhhhhhhh! Go‚Äô Head bro. Way to handle your business, dawg!!!!!!!! Proud of ya. Keep grinding. And btw....my Birthday is tomorrow...so thanks for the early Birthday present.

J-E-T-S! JETS JETS JETS!

This is some straight BS. How many penalties are the @nyjets gonna get called against them? The officials are doing all they can to GIVE this game to the @dallascowboys. I swear!

I chatted with @patrickbetdavid about my career path and lots more! Watch it here:

Clemson demanded an apology. Well, they got it dammit! Y'all satisfied?

You can watch the full @RapRadar interview here:

The greatest accomplishment I've ever achieved in my life.

I've said this before. Jay-Z is ONE in a billion. But YOU CAN be Stephen A. Smith!

DABO, your impersonation of me was perfect üòÄ

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith ranked his top-5 college football players and Dabo had to come help him fix it.

Friday mood

@SportsCenter You mean like this? üòÄüòÄüòÄ #SCtop10

I think Zion's rookie year will be very similar to SHAQ's!

This is one of the most embarrassing performances I‚Äôve seen in MLB postseason history. The @Braves are getting blitzed 9-0....IN THE TOP OF THE 1ST INNING. @Braves‚Äô pitchers can‚Äôt get anyone out. Can‚Äôt throw strikes, either. ATL hasn‚Äôt been up to bat yet

I‚Äôve said it many times and I‚Äôll say it again: if Ben Simmons develops a jump shot, the @76ers will win the NBA Title

I absolutely, positively loveeeeeed this (via @thecheckdown). Mayfield started this at Ohio State. This was payback. All in fun. It‚Äôs competition ppl. Suck it up

Lord Have Mercy. Zion might not even make it to the playoffs and still.........I can‚Äôt wait for this upcoming NBA Season! Might be the best season in 25 years!

RT @FirstTake : ‚ÄúThis is some inexcusable stuff.‚Äù

Sorry @Cowboys‚Äô fans. I‚Äôm know you‚Äôre hurting this morning. So I just wanted to take a few minutes to try and make ya feel better, ya hear?üòÄ#Haaaaaaaa

Hell Yes. I remember

How about THEM COWBOYS?!?!?!

Should college athletes get paid? I discussed with @MadisonSiriusXM.

RT @GetUpESPN : .@stephenasmith has strong feelings about that whole 'blazer with no tie' look

What is going on in this work....especially on ‚Äú@GetUpESPN this AM? @Espngreeny has every single person up there with blazers on ‚Äî no tie ‚Äî with everyone of them looking like they‚Äôre trying to audition for @Chippendales. Even @LRiddickESPN. What is up, fellas? #Haaaaaaa!!!!

This right here is what it‚Äôs all about: reaching back, extending a helping hand to those less fortunate than ourselves. And the fact that HBCU‚Äôs were smack dab in middle of whole process made it even better. Thank you all. My team & I could not have pulled this off without you!

Oh, Hell Yes! Welcome to the pros, @Zionwilliamson . Ecstatic that you‚Äôre here. Now, know this......

I'm gonna give @Dloading the benefit of the doubt!

@Dame_Lillard I feel you bro. I DID say the lyrics were definitely better. But I love the beat Shaq used and the smooth delivery. But I hear ya! Jalen Ike it down this morning on @First Take

Y‚Äôall, the very beginning of the AL Wild Card Game is being streamed here! And the whole damn game is on ESPN :-)

Haaaaaaa! Unreal.....about anyone in the world BUT Anthony Kornheiser. He probably said: ‚ÄúDamn, the Nats blew it again. Same ole, Same ole. I‚Äôm going to bed‚Äù.........in the top of the 8th inning üòÄüòÄüòÄ.  Hilarious.

What a game! What a game! Bases loaded, @Nationals down 3-1 and Soho smacks a single to right. Error by R-Fielder and 3 runs score, bottom of the 8th. Nats take a 3-1 lead. THIS is what October‚Äôs are made for

RT @FirstTake : Here's @stephenasmith with an updated A-list for the Top 5 NFL teams this season:

Ahhhhhh this is TOUGH!!!! I gotta say, I think @SHAQ got the best of @Dame_Lillard this round!!!!

This message goes out to @Matt_Barnes22 and @DaTrillStak5.

Enjoyed chatting with @patrickbetdavid about my background, how I got into journalism, and much more!

Howdy and welcome to the Stephen A. Smith Show üòâ

I blame the Cowboys' offense for the loss.

How about THEM Cowboys?!?!?!

@Saints Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!

Looks like Teddy Bridgewater just lost this damn game for the @Saints by allowing that sack.......unless the @Saints defense manages to hold......which I doubt. But we‚Äôll see.

A few things to take notice from today‚Äôs games: the @Browns answered the call and showed out. They deserve their props. So do the @Lions, win, lose or draw, along with the @BuffaloBills. Haskins was thrown into the lions den and looked miserable. Shocked if Gruden isn‚Äôt gone 2day

It ain‚Äôt about just smoking weed. It‚Äôs about LOSING money over doing it, DAMMIT!

The best player in the world is still @KingJames.

RT @ARBernard : Your power to resist temptation is proportionate to your submission to God. #ARBWisdom #power #temptation #believe #faith #trustGod

Stay off the WEEEEEED

You‚Äôre more than welcome

Thank you

Haaaaa. Thanks my man.

It's fair to call Baker Mayfield overrated.......for NOW!

It was truly an honor to bring @FirstTake to the @hbcuweek Career Fair. Delaware State University accepted more than 250 applicants on the spot and awarded well over $1 million in scholarships. There have been 100 Full Ride Scholarships awarded so far. (üìπ via WITN Channel 22)

RT @FirstTake : If the door was open for black ownership in the NFL, @stephenasmith says he could find 5 that are interested by Friday.

@JabariJYoung My Brother. So.....So proud of you and all you‚Äôve accomplished. You make me proud every time I see your work. Keep grinding. Keep climbing. Keep setting that example. Love ya bro! See ya soon.

@REALDJPREMIER @gangstarr Haaaa. Thanks my man

When that beat drops ...

Here's what we learned about the Redskins.

I think Jay Gruden just lost his job tonight. What a disgraceful performance by the @Redskins offense. This is @FiftyDeuce you‚Äôre going against. Why is he being covered 1-on-1. The @ChicagoBears are having their way. I guess you can blame injuries, but damn! Year-after-year.

I think it's over for Antonio Brown. Unless a personality transplant occurs.

Ladies & Gentlemen, in the interest of fairness I have an announcement to make, regardless of outcome: the @Giants have a new QB. And his name is Daniel Jones. Helluva game thus far

This means the world to me.

The @UMichFootball had 2 Damn Weeks to prepare for this game. Can‚Äôt stop the run. Can‚Äôt pressure. No discipline. And that‚Äôs just the defense. The offense is so much worse. They should be ashamed of the way they look. They can‚Äôt run. Can‚Äôt protect the QB. Just horrible.#Damn!

I‚Äôm done watching this @BadgerFootball vs @UMichFootball game. UM is getting DESTROYED. Beat like they stole something. This is embarrassing. So much for Harbaugh‚Äôs team having a chance this game. Just a joke. I‚Äôm done!

Good Lord. The first QT hasn‚Äôt even ended yet and @BadgerFootball‚Äôs Jonathan Taylor already has 2 TD‚Äôs and 143-yards rushing after just scampering for a 72-yard TD run. The way @UMichFootball Offense is looking, this game is already over. Can‚Äôt see them coming back.

Just ruled a non-catch by @UMichFootball‚Äôs Bell. Bogus. Should‚Äôve been a catch. This kid is the only thing I like about the Wolverines‚Äô Offense right now.

Damn great catch by @UMichFootball Ronnie Bell. Big time catch.....completely extended on that 22-yard catch. The kid can play. Ball can touch ground so long as it‚Äôs completely secure so it should be ruled a catch. But again, the kid‚Äôs got skills.

In @UMichFootball‚Äôs opening drive, we saw a WR devoid of breakaway speed, a QB that couldn‚Äôt connect on a slant pattern over the middle for a TD, and a RB (Mason) who committed their 9th fumble of the season (6 lost). And we‚Äôre wondering why Harbaugh won‚Äôt win w/ these guys?

I said what I said!

RT @TroyVincentSr : Thanks to @stephenasmith and @FirstTake for having me on to chat about the impact of #HBCUs on sport and society.

Damn! Very little surprises me. Even less moves me. But my college boys ‚Äî my teammates ‚Äî surprising me like this. Unreal!!!

What a duo this could have been

RT @FirstTake : You know @stephenasmith had to make in entrance for HBCU week!

Here‚Äôs what to expect from @FirstTake today LIVE from @hbcuweek!

I‚Äôm here @hbcuweek!!! @FirstTake

I‚Äôm with you when you‚Äôre right @TomBrady. Too many damn penalties. Something has to give.

What the hell is going. This kid Minshew is out here for the @Jaguars looking like the 2nd coming for Joe Montana. @Titans had better get something going or this can get ugly REAL QUICK!

I discussed elite black athletes and HBCU's on the @karenhunter show. Listen to full show here:

Here's how I became an ambassador for @hbcuweek. Only a few days away from being there! Thanks @Hot97 for having me...

As far as I'm concerned, the Browns had a bye week.

I am having a VERY BAD DAY

The Dolphins are as BAD as it gets right now. Sad to say it but it‚Äôs just the truth!

My reply to recent comments against @TimTebow......

Interviewed by @KDTrey5 on his ESPN+ show @boardroom, hosted by @RealJayWilliams. Kevin spoke the truth and I didn‚Äôt hold back either! Don‚Äôt miss it!

Coming soon... @boardroom. You will really need to buckle up for this one.

I saw this book title and couldn‚Äôt help but laugh and sympathize with the author, aka @RealSkipBayless‚Äô wife. Y‚Äôall go check out the book!

Another clownish diatribe from Antonio Brown. But I‚Äôd still PLAY him....for now

I always do. You do the same bro. I‚Äôm not hiding. I‚Äôve done nothing but show you and your brother the utmost respect. Always. And I‚Äôve called it like I‚Äôve seen it. You make sure you do the same and there won‚Äôt be any issues this way.

I‚Äôm not selling out. I‚Äôm looking out.

Yes @cthagod asked me about my DAMN hairline! And he‚Äôs right: I just might need to let it all go :-)

Now I know!

What I said and I still mean it. If anyone puts their hands on you and talks Sh&$@, what would you say or do. Come on bro? I‚Äôve got respect for you and your bro ‚Äî like I said ‚Äî but you know you had no business doing that......if you weren‚Äôt playing around. I thought you were!

Nobody has any right to put there hands on someone. I‚Äôd like to believe you know that. I respect you ‚Äî and your fam ‚Äî as well as your right to not like me, etc. But putting your hands and someone, then claiming you actually wished harm, is different. So based on that I meant...

Ain‚Äôt about being done tough guy bro. I simply pointed out how I though you were playing around a couple of years ago, and then YOU publicly stated what your real intent was AFTERWARD to someone in the media. So I said, had I known...it wouldn‚Äôt have gone down like that. Period!

Loved hanging out with The @breakfastclubam. Appreciate their question about how I got started.

RT @breakfastclubam : "In the world of sports, we have too many players who are being celebrated without winning" - @stephenasmith üôå

Welcome to AMERICA!!!!!

I think @KDTrey5 is focused on being the best player in today's game, not necessarily history.

You can watch the full interview here.

I talked about being an HBCU week ambassador on @breakfastclubam.

RT @breakfastclubam : our guy @StephenASmith is in the hot seat tomorrow!!! üî•

Don‚Äôt miss this tomorrow üòÄ @breakfastclubam

Hey @OBJ.... can't you just WIN first????

I wanted to elaborate with my thoughts on Antonio Brown.

RT @SXMUrbanView : Coming up on the @karenhunter show - #KarenRebels

My top 5 NFL teams after week 1 are.....

I would not be where I am today if it wasn‚Äôt for the education and experience I had at an HBCU. I can't wait for @espn to be in Wilmington for @hbcuweek!

I've never seen selfishness like this. I just don‚Äôt want to hear a different opinion on this:

RT @GetUpESPN : "He should be ashamed of himself. His family should be ashamed of him. His friends should be ashamed of him."

Damn! Damn! Damn! You Big Ben, can you figure out a way to beat Brady is Foxboro ONE DAMN TIME! F$&@&)$&@@&$!!!!!!

Or maybe not. Matthew Stanford is good for comebacks during the regular season.

Okay @K1, I see you. I see you. 18 pets in the 4th QT for the @AZCardinals. Scored tied at 24 with seconds left. OT is about to arrive.

Just a disgraceful performance by the @MiamiDolphins. They‚Äôre down 42-3 BEFORE the half ‚Äî at HOME ‚Äî but that‚Äôs not the only reason. They are dropping passes left & right. Missing tackles, etc. Flores has his work cut out for him. Just a horrible performance.

Also, one big surprise, another not so big: A.) @Redskins are kicking the @Eagles butt right in Philadelphia, 17-0. B.) No surprise at all that the Rams are all over Cam Newton. They‚Äôre only up 10-0, but Csm has been over-throwing or under-throwing in the 1st Half=No Surprise!

Nice move by my man @tkelce for a 41-yard hookup from @PatrickMahomes. Again, Jags far less impressive than I expected. I know the @Chiefs offense is a juggernaut, but still. Btw.....MaHomes is now being helped off field. He‚Äôs limping

Peeps, maybe it‚Äôs just that the @MiamiDolphins defense is just this bad. But y‚Äôall need to know: @Lj_era8 is putting on a damn show for the @Ravens. His throws are right on target. He‚Äôs flinging this football all over the field. If he runs & throws, God help rest of the NFL.

MaHomes to Watkins on a drag route = 49-yard TD connection. Too many plays thus far where @chiefs receivers are wide open. Not the Jacksonville defense I expected. Oh, Btw, Nick Foles our for rest of game w/ shoulder injury on that TD throw. Damn!

OMG. Lamar Jackson just connected with Brown on an 83-yard bomb for a TD. Perfect throw from Lamar. And this kid, Brown: a rookie. First 2 catches of NFL career=Both TD. Young brother is putting on a show. Horrible start for @MiamiDolphins, down 21-0 to @Ravens.

That was just a damn-good TD pass from Foles. The @Jaguars didn‚Äôt see that in years with Blake Bortles as their  QB. This is what they paid Foles for. We‚Äôll see if it continues.

Some folks are some damn fools! Y‚Äôall go ahead and applaud AB all y‚Äôall want. After chasing all that money, w/ security, he‚Äôs now playing ONE YEAR AT A TIME. Period. Don‚Äôt get me started. Man, I can‚Äôt wait for @FirstTake on Monday.

@Raiders He‚Äôs too great not to land with another team if he wants to. But his days of getting his money has officially come to an end.#SoSad

@Raiders Right decision. You cannot act this way and get away with it. Maybe my man Max is right. Maybe there really is something wrong. AB fought all this time to make this money, then just threw it all away before playing a single game. Disgraceful.

The Biggest Crow I‚Äôve ever eaten in my career at ESPN!

Top 5 reasons the Cowboys ain‚Äôt winning the Super Bowl!

Boy I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but I can‚Äôt see it.

Bottom line: Jon Gruden looks weak as hell w/ this call. A 1-game suspension secures Raiders having freedom to cut ties w/ AB in event he continues to engage in insubordination ‚Äî assuming reports are true ‚Äî and you give that up??? That is just PATHETIC. Gruden will regret this.

Me years ago. RJ now. Who did it better?

I‚Äôm baaaaaaack

RT @FirstTake : Make your way down to Texas Live now to hang with @stephenasmith, @maxkellerman and @MollyQerim!

I figured: why wait to annoy Dallas Cowboys fans when I could start right now.

Haaaaa! That must mean the brother is looking smooth :-)

As I said earlier on @FirstTake, Antonio Brown has brought this on himself. All this noise is utterly ridiculous!

Thank you sir. Much appreciated

Get drug tested immediately please

Blessings bro

Yes Sir

Please

Don‚Äôt have to. The Stsr comes to me

Thank you

I AM back

Nope

Damn Right

So turn the channel and lose out

Thank you so much

What up!

I picked the Bears

I‚Äôm in town right now bro

Whatever clown. You wouldn‚Äôt know how I speak if you weren‚Äôt watching. Fall the hell back and take notes.

And then some :-)

You know it

Not at all. Summer‚Äôs are slow, so that‚Äôs the time to take off. I won‚Äôt be off for a while now. I‚Äôm back in full effect

That‚Äôs my brother right there. Love that dude. He‚Äôs always welcomed

I actually agree with you at this point

Haaaa

Damn right

Thanks bro

Haaa. Not my fault. I‚Äôm in a Newspsper building. Not a TV studio. Can‚Äôt control  the lighting.

You don‚Äôt have a choice. Not if you‚Äôre watching sports. Get use to it

I‚Äôve already invaded Dallas and I can‚Äôt wait for Friday üòÄ

@RealMichaelKay This has always been my mentality.

Here's the story of my first ever audition for ESPN, as I told @RealMichaelKay.

My 4 distinct voices on @FirstTake, as told to @RealMichaelKay :-)

I have no doubt. But I‚Äôve got some news for the Gauff‚Äôs: Coco won‚Äôt be the only one. They‚Äôll be a significant part of history, too. What an absolutely beautiful family they are. And what a magnificent job they‚Äôre doing as parents. Kudos to the whole family.

Y‚Äôall go right ahead and applaud Josh Gordon all you want. I‚Äôll pray for the brother. But I‚Äôm not going that far:

RT @FirstTake : This is @stephenasmith‚Äôs strategy if he had to take on @CocoGauff üòÇ

I'd rather have prime @KobeBryant than prime @Shaq. It‚Äôs really simple when you think about it:

Here's why I say @KobeBryant's comments were more foul than fair:

Ahhhh Stephen A is popular in Saudi Arabia HUH?!!

RT @FirstTake : If you're looking for AB on @stephenasmith's A. List of the Top 5 NFL WR's this season, you won't find him and he explains why:

I appreciate a lot of folks position on this. I just don‚Äôt agree

Colts owner Jim Irsay is MOST to blame for Andrew Luck's retirement!

Proud to be an HBCU graduate! Calling ALL HBCUs to participate in Career Fair at @hbcuweek. Students will participate in an, ‚Äúon the spot‚Äù acceptance process whereby, if they come with copies of requisite ACT/SAT score + transcript they could be admitted into college on the spot.

Guess who‚Äôs subbing for @MollyQerim today, filling in as Host on @FirstTake this morning: the WONDERFUL @ROSGO21. Tune in at the top of the hour. And YES! We‚Äôre finally back in ESPN for the full 2 hours

True! But I‚Äôm working on it :-)

RT @Cosmo_Con : @FirstTake @OmariHardwick @stephenasmith @maxkellerman @MollyQerim Power The Final Season bout to be Epic!!!! August 25th 2019

He is more than entitled to call my position ludicrous. @E_Reid35 has earned the right to do that. He‚Äôs good with me. I have no idea how he feels about me. Nor do I care. But I respect him and what he‚Äôs trying to do for US. Period!

Sorry folks. Not taking the bait. While I believe @E_Reid35 could handle certain situations better (I.e. Malcolm Jenkins, Jay-Z), I will never disrespect this man. He‚Äôs fighting for US. I can disagree with his approach and still maintain Profound Respect for him, which I do.

......before condemning the man? Kap said he wanted action. You co-signed that. So let‚Äôs see what he actually does. You basically calling him a sellout is low. There‚Äôs more than 1 way to skin a cat. You way warrants respect. But it ain‚Äôt the ONLY. Think about that please.

Fair enough @E_Reid35. But you weren‚Äôt advocating for him to keep it either. You were advocating for something far greater than that ‚Äî something that transcends you and Kap ‚Äî which is why you both deserve our profound respect & gratitude. But how about seeing what Jay does 1st!

Here's what I'm saying about Jay-Z partnering with the NFL...

That‚Äôs a flat-out ignorant perspective and not what I said. I have a radio show every weekday where I take callers. Don‚Äôt hide behind twitter. I ain‚Äôt hard to find. Not running from a damn soul. You ‚Äî and anyone who thinks like you ‚Äî know exactly where to find me.#call@UrOwnRisk

I don‚Äôt lie, bro. No ones important enough for me to lie too

I ain‚Äôt finished bro. I‚Äôve got a lot more coming

Yep! Because you‚Äôre being emotional for your 15 min. But you‚Äôre not thinking of the collateral damage. Of course we all should speak out. But there‚Äôs a time, place - and way ‚Äî for everything. Especially when you‚Äôre US!

Green Bay without Aaron Rodgers is just some DAMN place with CHEESE!

Thanks bro. Can't call out ignorance if you never allow it to be displayed.

I'd be a BIGGER fantasy football player if I didn't find @MollyQerim CHEAT in our league üòÄ

This is NOT about Rich Paul being black. It's about his relationship with @KingJames!

When I spoke to the University of Alabama football team, my advice to them applies to you too: ‚ÄúWhen you represent a brand, your behavior matters, your character matters and trust matters."

The Cowboys are my favorite ü§£ü§£

Told the Alabama Football players this story about Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan!

@DezBryant When you act up, you‚Äôve got to wait. He‚Äôs a bad brother....as in good. He‚Äôll get his money. By would should Jerry rush to accommodate him.

Every DAMN body needs to hear this. And that even includes the Alabama Football Program.

RT @KSTiLLS : ü§î You can‚Äôt have a non profit with this mission statement then open your doors to Trump.

Damn! I‚Äôm actually pissed off that I‚Äôm on vacation today. Would‚Äôve loved to be on-air talking about the NCAA and their bull$&@$ rule regarding agent certification. Major major props to @KingJames for calling it exactly what it is. Straight B.S. Just Shameful!

The Big 3 was supposed to be LeBron, D-Wade and MELO. I've been saying it for YEARS!

RT @SportsCenter : Carmelo tells @stephenasmith about his conversation with Chris Paul and James Harden after his time in Houston. (via @FirstTake)

I‚Äôve heard an awful lot about how Daryl Morey handled letting him go. I believe Melo on that. Ouch!

He ASKED for this! He REQUESTED this! 1-on-1 with ME. Evidently, he‚Äôs got some stuff to get off his chest. @FirstTake in the house right at the top of the hour. Buckle Up!

This is hard for me because Melo is MY guy, but NO I do NOT think he deserves a farewell tour. Farewell Tours should be reserved for........

I think @KingJames is about to remind everyone this season he's THAT dude.

Grandma Joyce, it was so sweet to have you on the show. :-)

YEP. IF Anthony Davis doesn't win the TITLE with @KingJames, it's a FAILURE.

Since everyone is asking what happened to my arm, here ya go...

When you call into my show, you will refer to me as Stephen A. or Mr. Smith.

Sorry, but I need to start off this day with a non-sports related matter. Watching these videos of kids throwing buckets of water at the NYPD is just flat-out inexcusable. And we all need to speak out AGAINST this. We are really losing ourselves if we find any of this okay!!!!

RT @ARBernard : You got up today for a reason! #ARBWisdom #newday #intention

Keith Thurman = very classy in defeat.

Should not have even been a split decision. @MannyPacquiao outclassed him most of the fight, period. Wasn‚Äôt even close. At least the final decision was the right now. But if Pacman knows what‚Äôs good for him, he‚Äôll stay away from @terencecrawford  and @ErrolSpenceJr. I know THAT!

I‚Äôve got @MannyPacquiao winning this fight 8 rounds to 4. 116-112

Plain and Simple: Thurman needs a knockout to win this fight. Period. Not a knockDOWN. He needs a knockOUT

I gave @MannyPacquiao the 7th because of that late charge and have him ahead 5 rounds to 2. But Thurman has been most effective when he‚Äôs moving and making Pacman chase.

Just busier in Round 6. I‚Äôm waiting for @MannyPacquiao to get tired so Thurman can find him. But it‚Äôs not looking that way right now. It‚Äôs Boxing, though. One punch can change everything.

Thurman gets round 6

Oh Damn! Thurman got beat up in that round. @MannyPacquiao is all over him. Has his nose bleeding. Thurman was hurt in around 5. Manny‚Äôs footwork is impressive. He looks faster. Uh Oh!

Yes! I‚Äôm off vacation. Back on @FirstTake on a Monday. Watching this fight right now. Got @MannyPacquiao winning first 3 rounds. Thurman gets around 4. Strangely, seems to be wearing Pacman down a touch, but who knows

It's been a rough morning. Thanks for the hug, @MollyQerim.

FYI.....due to Wimbledon, @FirstTake will be on ESPN2 today. Well, maybe y‚Äôall shouldn‚Äôt watch. Because I don‚Äôt know what the hell im going to say this morning.

My Knicks are so damn bad right now, to hell with it. Just listen to the folks and social media and adopt this:

I just finished crying!

Noise is elevating. @kawhileonard and @JimmyButler to the @LAClippers. We‚Äôll see if this really happens. But it definitely makes sense now that @tobias31 has agreed to re-sign with the @sixers

Since @KDTrey5 is now heading to the @BrooklynNets it‚Äôs @kawhileonard who‚Äôs providing the most suspense. And this much is for sure: The @LAClippers do not believe the @Lakers will get him ahead of them. They believe it‚Äôs them or the @Raptors . We‚Äôll see.

All I can tell you is this: when I spoke to @CP3 yesterday. He categorically DENIES making a trade request.

If you‚Äôre the LAKERS, you better be DAMN excited!!!

It is a mistake to dismiss @KingJames from this conversation:

If you‚Äôre the Warriors, here‚Äôs how you have to look at everything. #NBAFinals

The Future still looks bright for the Warriors.........eventually!

The Raptors smelled blood and went for it! World Champions. Wow!!!

Congratulations! No matter what, the @Raptors deserve credit. Focused. Poised. And they played together.

Here was what I was talking about

Yes! @KlayThompson was suppose to be done. But then he wasn‚Äôt. Carried off the court one minute, ran right out the next. He said: ‚ÄúHell No! I‚Äôm not going out like this!‚Äù

The @Raptors are up 43-38. And right now, Lowry just looks absolutely exceptional. Making 3‚Äôs. Running the office. Moving the BBall. Siakam & Van Vleet are making shots, too. The @warriors will not win this game unless the figure out Lowry.

My State Of Mind heading into Game 6:

YEP. I‚Äôm picking the Warriors to win tonight!! #NBAFinals

I‚Äôm joining #HoopStreams live from the #NBAFinals. Come watch!

Another @SportsCenter special, coming up now!!! Catch me on ESPN.

It's moments like this where I wish I was STILL on the scene!

Yo, @Espngreeny, I thought @GetUpESPN was YOUR Show! Don‚Äôt you let @mspears96 convince you that them damn @dallascowboys need to be discussed today. He‚Äôs another nauseating Cowboys‚Äô lover ‚Äî who will be dealt with once FOOTBALL season arrives. Damn all those ‚ÄòBoys lovers üòÄüòÄüòÄ

It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve done a Q&A so here I go. Submit questions using #AskStephenA and I‚Äôll get to as many as as I can.

I was near the elevator with the champagne! And then that DAMN timeout happened!

Yes! I thought @KDtrey5 should‚Äôve played last night. Nobody‚Äôs hiding:

Awful lots to discuss on @FirstTake today. @KDTrey5! Should he have played? Free agency? The list goes on-and-on. See y‚Äôall at top of the hour.

Pay no attention to folks who think that way. They don‚Äôt know basketball. All the best to you and KD, wishing him a speedy recovery.

Damn! It‚Äôs over! It‚Äôs all over folks. @KDTrey5 goes down with 9:46 left in the half. Had 11 points. Ballin! @Warriors in control, and he goes down. Possibly his Achilles this time! Damn! Damn! Damn! Hard to see the @Raptors not winning now. What a shame!

KD getting hurt there might have been one of the most depressing moments I‚Äôve experienced covering basketball.

Damn! What a shocker that game was. Gotta point to Nick Nurse on that one!

Makes me sadder every time I look at this:

I‚Äôm just so damn sad right now. The Finals: Ruined! I wanted to see @KDTrey5 come back so badly. He was ballin, too. En route to dropping 40 the way he was looking. Then this. Damn! Damn! Damn!

I‚Äôm picking the Warriors to win Game 5! #NBAFinals

I think whoever wins Game 5 will win the whole thing ...

My @SportsCenter Special starts now on ESPN!!!

I‚Äôm hosting a @SportsCenter special once again! 7pm EST here I come!!

Ladies and gentlemen, the future is here. I present to you: Siri A. Smith.

My buddy Katie Nolan got me to do this:

Preparing for your disagreement in 3...2...1...

Aaahhhhh Haaaaaa! This stuff Gets funnier and funnier. @SnoopDogg.....you crazy!

If the Knicks don't sign @KDTrey5 this summer, YES, James Dolan should sell the DAMN team!

Or if this kind of reaction is more your thing, enjoy! #Haaaaaa

Kevin Durant returning is the Warriors‚Äô only shot now at winning the title!!!

Yo! @KDTrey5, it‚Äôs your turn now! You are the @Warriors last chance.

The Raptors are hanging in there!

Are you listening, @KingJames???

Mood.

Here's how I believe we should really look at this Kyle Lowry situation with the Warriors' Minority Owner.

A beautiful anniversary to celebrate.

Should the Warriors still be confidant after Game 3‚Äôs loss?

I am watching you @maxkellerman. You know how to do radio ‚Äî we all know that ‚Äî but you‚Äôre filling me for ME on MY radio show........due to my pathetic, sick self. Hold it down, my Brother! Hold it Down! I‚Äôm watching (Haaaaaaa)!

RJ May be a Knick. So it warranted some interrogation.

Steph Curry went BALLISTIC, but the Warriors needed more help.

The two prolific NBA Finals Scorers in a loss:

Do these Finals meet our expectations.....

Draymond Green is the key to tonight‚Äôs game!!

Me and the commish during my @SportsCenter special!

See y‚Äôall at the top of the hour:

I heard @GQMagazine is doing a story on me. It's about time, DAMNIT! üòÄüòÄ

OH NOOOOO!!!! Say it ain‚Äôt so!!!

RT @FirstTake : Things @stephenasmith is hearing:

Yeah! Yeah! @FirstTake Primetime special on ESPN......begins right now!!!!

MX????

Nope! No matter what you say

Do you say that about the white commentators who never played or been in a fight? Don‚Äôt bother answering. We already know. Go sit down please. At least until you‚Äôre interested in being fair

My hairline is kinda jacked up :-)

How about neither. I just said what I mean and mean what I suitor

Not about his physique

THANK YOU!!!!

Why the violence? Is that the answer? Guess so for weak cats that ain‚Äôt paid to fight but lack discipline. Thanks for showing who you are

I said he LOOKED like Butterbean. The man has more cleavage than some women. What do you want from me :-)

I own what the Hell I say and mean. Not others interpretations of what I say or mean.

Haaaa. Thanks bro

I know

I will bro. Im@not going any damn place. I‚Äôm right here. Energy as vibrant as ever.

This message goes out to @canelo and @Andy_destroyer1.

Know what you‚Äôre talking about and what point I‚Äôm making before coming st me @Canelo. Please do me that favor.

Because the loss robbed us of the magnitude a MEGAFIGHT gives us @Canelo. How do YOU of all ppl not know that? You gave us you vs GGG. You didn‚Äôt make us wait. So this isn‚Äôt about knowing boxing. This is about Boxing continuing to rob us of the fights we want WHEN we want them.

Congratulations @Canelo. Your tweet at me may be one of the most ignorant tweets I‚Äôve ever received. Once again, I have no issue with @Andy_destroyer1. Congrats to him. My issue was with boxing fans being made to WAIT, the ultimately robbed of our interest in Wilder vs. Joshua...

Ok fine I‚Äôll do it.

@LennoxLewis @Andy_destroyer1 Gone @LennoxLewis. Just like it was gone once Riddick Bowe let things get in the way of him vs. you. You had a war with Holyfield that offset it, but that‚Äôs my point: it shouldn‚Äôt freakin happen. Give us the fights we want WHEN we want them an no ones complaining about Ruiz.#Damn

@LennoxLewis @Andy_destroyer1 What you don‚Äôt realize @LennoxLewis is the same thing I just explained to @Andy_destroyer1: I wasn‚Äôt questioning his skills nor his resume. I was lamenting the fact that ONCE AGAIN boxing has screwed us by not giving us the fight we wanted to see: Wilder vs. Joshua. The luster is

@Andy_destroyer1 We want them. If that is your definition of disrespect @Andy_destroyer1, I am sorry to inform you there is nothing I can do for you. Congratulations to you and mad respect. But forgive me if I‚Äôm more disgusted with Wilder vs Joshua RUINED than I am in celebrating you.#MayBE2moro

@Andy_destroyer1 I completely stand by that. You are to be respected for your skills. You‚Äôre damn good and you deserve our praise and respect. But Joshua getting completely outclassed by you is the latest reminder of how Boxibg repeatedly cheats us all by not giving us the fights we want WHEN....

@Andy_destroyer1 .....to see. Fair or unfair, the public was clamoring for Wilder vs. Joshua. That is not a knock against you. You‚Äôve proven your worth and your time has arrived. But it came at the expense of a megafight that is no more. That is what I was saying. That it what I was decrying. And

@Andy_destroyer1 What I questioned was A.) How you looked physically (all due respect.....as has everyone else) and the fact that a megafight was ruined because Anthony Joshua got his butt whipped by you. A Megafight isn‚Äôt just about the fighters themselves, but who people are actually salivating

@Andy_destroyer1 With all due respect Ruiz, I‚Äôd prefer to return the favor by encouraging you to do your own research or, more simply, to quote me accurately! By no means did I insult your career. Never even questioned it. In fact, I specifically recall acknowledging that you‚Äôre pretty damn good.

This man @KendrickPerkins had the AUDACITY to interrupt my DAMN Instagram Live!

YEP

The Warriors resembled a Championship Team tonight.

Just had the pleasure of meeting the man himself: @BarackObama is in the house at the game. Asked if I needed to calm down. He said: ‚ÄúNope! It‚Äôs working for you. Run with it!‚Äù No reason for me to go against HIS advice.#Haaaaaa

He‚Äôs got a glass jaw. That is the point. Mega fight = Ruined. That is my damn point, ppl. Wake up!

I watched the fight 3x. Look, Ruiz is good. Solid boxer. Fast hands. But everyone‚Äôs missing the point: THE FIGHT we were all waiting for ‚Äî Wilder vs. Joshua ‚Äî is officially ruined. No one with sense believes Joshua has a chance vs him now, even if he goes back and beats Ruiz.

I‚Äôm sick over this. For myself! For fight fans. And especially for Deontay Wilder ‚Äî who should‚Äôve been the one administering this TKO. I‚Äôm so freakin disgusted right now!

OMG! OMG! I cannot believe this S$&@$! Anthony Joshua ‚Äî holder of 3 belts, gets TKO‚Äôd by Butter Bean.......I mean some dude named Andy Ruiz JR. What a damn disgrace. Joshua looked completely gassed! More fatigued than hurt! Now how in the Hell did you let that happen? How?

What better song to play?

I feel some level of responsibility for this ...

If Kevin Durant wants a damn pedicure and massage every day, the Knicks WOULD make it happen.

RT @FirstTake : "HE'S DRAKE, DAMMIT ... Do people in power need to have control over every damn thing?"

The fact that the Warriors lost in this fashion is very very surprising to me.

I CAN‚ÄôT believe what I saw!!!!

The Raptors‚Äô top ambassador. Praying I‚Äôm wrong about them!

Caption this ...

Warriors in 6. #NBAFinals

Joining #HoopStreams with @CassidyHubbarth!

Haaaaaaaa. Finally! Remove those notes though üòÄ

Ya boy is hosting @SportsCenter, starting right NOW!!!!!

RT @FirstTake : .@stephenasmith still doesn‚Äôt understand why the news in Canada is leading with hockey. üòÇ

The fellas!!

Enjoyed chatting with @frntofficesport about my NBA Finals plans. Buckle up!!

RT @FirstTake : "I've seen Magic beyond the smile."

Ty Lue should have been an AUTOMATIC hire for the Lakers.

Yes, @KobeBryant was LIVID his name was even mentioned amid all of this Lakers mess!

Check out the squad and I on Sports Center tomorrow night, 7/8pm EST LIVE on ESPN. NBA Finals Preview Show.# Buckle Up!

Some people just need to keep their mouths shut about @KobeBryant. It‚Äôs Blasphemy!!!!

@ChrisBHaynes Hell-to-the-NO @ChrisBHaynes. I haven‚Äôt played in 3 years and you just gonna drop this on my 50-plus-year-old ass? Just because YOU walk around wearing sneakers with those damn suits all the time doesn‚Äôt mean the rest of us do. I AM NOT playing. HELLLLLLL Nah! :-)

Is this what y‚Äôall want????

RT @ESPNPR : Get ready for the NBA Finals with Tuesday's SportsCenter Special...

Y‚Äôall really NEED to stop with these baby filters ü§£ü§£

I'm sick and tired of Klay Thompson being underappreciated.

Prioritize free agency OVER the NBA Finals??? EXCUSE me?



The Bucks have no answer for Kawhi ...

RT @FirstTake : Toronto or Milwaukee: Who's it going to be for the East?

I have NO problem with what @Drake has been doing. In fact, I love it. üòÄ

Fans DESERVE the right to watch their player hoist that trophy!!!!

This is a part of my story!

Yes. THIS is LeBron's BEST chance at a title.

üôÑüôÑüôÑ

People calling Magic Johnson lazy??? RIDICULOUS.

I have absolutely no problem with @KDTrey5's reaction to @Chris_Broussard. He's not USING a bunch of other people to speak for him üòÄ

This is a fact.

Has there ever been a bigger indictment on the Lakers organization in the modern era?

I knew some of the details, but I was frankly shocked with how much other information Magic Johnson revealed today.

It was fascinating to hear @MagicJohnson today talk about how he felt that Rob Pelinka was backstabbing him.

RT @FirstTake : .@magicjohnson explains in full the reason why he stepped down as the Lakers president.

I don‚Äôt NEED to talk today. All I need to do is LISTEN. @MagicJohnson is here!!!!!

You are NOT going to want to miss this tomorrow. @MagicJohnson is joining @FirstTake!

RT @FirstTake : The words coming out of @maxkellerman's mouth have @stephenasmith puzzled ü§î

OMG! What a game. What a game. And I know @StephenCurry30 is doing his thing but I‚Äôm sooo proud of little brother Seth. That kid stepped off the bench and has drilled some key 3‚Äôa. He‚Äôs got 16. He‚Äôs making folks proud tonight.

Who the hell is this?

We need more people like Karen üòÄüòÄüòÄ

If you call the Stephen A. Smith show, answer my DAMN QUESTIONS.

@MRobertsNBPA @ShadowLeague @IsiahThomas @Cheurlin1788 @the Tremendous. And it never hurts to have the support of the wonderful @MRobertsNBPA. I love it.#Family

TODAY was one of the WORST days I've had in a VERY long time.

Welcome to my life.

UGH!!!!!!!

DAMMIT!!!!! Typical KNICKS!!!!!

I just can‚Äôt take it anymore. I just can‚Äôt.

I had to go to church to send a prayer up for my Knicks!

From what I've heard, there is "no way in hell" Kyrie Irving is going to the Lakers.

After watching the @HoustonRockets blow their chance vs the @Warriors, I‚Äôm convinced of this:

I don't care, Cleveland. GOOD LUCK!

Damnit! Y‚Äôall know I don‚Äôt have Global Entry right???

Damn! Damn! Damnnnnnnn!!!!!!

However, the @nuggets are pulling a @HoustonRockets Game 7 performance from last year: they can‚Äôt buy a 3-pt basket to save their lives. Can‚Äôt hit anything. Youthful guards we‚Äôve spent all season bragging about can‚Äôt do anything right now.

What a freakin game. This @nuggets vs @trailblazers Game is something else. A nail biter. And you know who the MVP is of this game? @CJMcCollum. What a phenomenal performance. He‚Äôs doing it all right now.

I wouldn't be surprised at all ...

My thoughts on Jason Kidd and the Lakers:

I didn‚Äôt need to sleep on it before I unleashed on the @HoustonRockets fall to the @warriors. But I did anyways. And now, I‚Äôm ready. Can‚Äôt wait to talk to y‚Äôall Monday on @FirstTake. Certain things just need to be said!!!!!!!

Yes. From everything I‚Äôve heard, KD and Kyrie are planning on coming to New York. 95% Chance they say! Only potential hiccup is KD changing his mind

Steph showed up when it mattered MOST!

Tie score with 4:30 left. @CP3 has played well. He‚Äôs stepped up. But they‚Äôve got to finish

WTH is going on? Are y‚Äôall seeing this. The @warriors got their young boys in. @StephenCurry30 has ZERO points, 4 fouls and is on the bench, and the @warriors are UP 6.#GoodLord

NEVER before have James Harden and Chris Paul been under MORE pressure in their career.

This is the truth, folks. It‚Äôs undeniable.

Yes. If LeBron James doesn't sign-off on the new Lakers head coach, he SHOULD demand a damn TRADE!

I think KYRIE IRVING is DONE in Boston. Here's a throwback to when he revealed on @FirstTake why he left the CAVS! #TBT

RT @GetUpESPN : The trade rumors surrounding LeBron James explained by @stephenasmith the only way he knows how. üòÇ

I'm told people in Hollywood have told Jeanie Buss to trade @KingJames!

I'm disappointed in James Harden and CP3 tonight

Good Lord! Thought @JHarden13 and @CP3 would seize the moment once @KDTrey5 went down. Harden didn‚Äôt do enough and CP didn‚Äôt do anything at all. Game 7 back here on Sunday.

OMG!!!! @KDTrey5 drills jumper then turns around and looks back s if someone kicked him. We know what that usually means: Ruptured Achilles. If it‚Äôs that, the @warriors just lost this series. And it will end in Houston on Friday night!

It's looking REALLY bad for the Lakers right now ...

What a DAMN ass whooping!

I still think the Warriors will win this series.

That's right, DAMMIT! I blame @KingJames for OBJ's recent comments!

First @SHAQ blasted @JoelEmbiid for looking at the stat sheet while on the bench and down by 40. Then Barkley and Kenny Smith chimed in. And I can‚Äôt disagree with any of them. If @sixers lose Thursday night, heads will role. Trust me. I know these folks.

Flagged being waved by @sixers with 8:58 left. What a damn shame. Let‚Äôs just hope that @JoelEmbiid feels better. That way we can find out what the rest of this crew is truly worth heading into this summer of free agency

The @sixers should be ashamed of themselves. Let‚Äôs take @JimmyButler at his word and acknowledge @JoelEmbiid is totally sick. What about @tobias31? What about @BenSimmons25 a loss is entirely different than an ass-kicking! I mean, WTH is up with this?#Damn!

How do I even respond to this?

I'm told Klay Thompson isn't happy and here's why.

I don't know WHAT the hell is going on with Klay Thompson.

NINE damn hours!!!

At this point, I truly believe LEBRON would be justified in asking for a trade. He‚Äôs probably setting the stage to do that right now!

I‚Äôm sorry, because I love the guy. But  @JoelEmbiid had NINE hours before the game started, and he's texting that he might NOT be ready to go?!?!



Wow! Bigtime 3 from @kawhileonard. Bigtime game from him, too. A spectacular performance, but also many missed opportunities from @tobias31. And @JoelEmbiid has had almost nothing today, due to being hurt. @sixers‚Äô chance to take over series = BLOWN!!!

In that final sequence, you‚Äôre @CP3 , you don‚Äôt drive into this lane at his height and size. You pull up for a jumper or find Gordon. Overtime has arrived!

His name is @KDTrey5. You know who he is! Y‚Äôall know who he is. The BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD!!!

About to join Hoop Streams with my main man @RealMikeWilbon!

I have a suggestion for the Rockets to win tonight‚Äôs game, DAMNIT!

I'm not gonna lie to you, I think there's a real possibility that Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard end up on the Clippers this summer.

RT @espnmma : With a win at #UFCOttawa, @Cowboycerrone should set his sights on Conor McGregor says @stephenasmith (via @FirstTake)

And for my full reaction, you can watch it on my Instagram TV!

Y‚Äôall know I had to do it

@JeanieBuss @MagicJohnson That‚Äôs very beautiful Ms. Jeanie Buss. But there isn‚Äôt a soul alive who‚Äôs ever questioned your relationship with Magic. We all know how much y‚Äôall love one another. Family! It‚Äôs someone else he had a problem with. But we‚Äôll leave that alone ‚Äî for NOW!!!!!!

I JUST heard the news about D‚ÄôAngelo Russell and..........

That one time I took on my twin brother CLEVELAND A. SMITH! ü§£ü§£ü§£ #TBT

It's OVER for the Rockets.

This TRULY is the Knicks' only help. üò¢

Durant was subpar but the combination of Draymond/Iguodala was TOO good! Good luck beating this team :)

üéß After Dark podcast: @Redskins President Bruce Allen joins the show to recap Washington's NFL Draft,.

With 2-good eyes in the 1st quarter, @JHarden13 couldn‚Äôt buy a basket. After returning Damn-near blind, he scores 12 points in last 7 min of 2nd QT. Go figure

So @JHarden13 had to leave with 6:27 left in the first QT due to an eye injury. And now look what‚Äôs happening: @CP3 is BALLIN. And oh! @AustinRivers25 isn‚Äôt doing bad, either, helping carry the @HoustonRockets right now. Lots of drama. Love it! But want @JHarden13 back out there.

üéßAfter Dark podcast: @WindhorstESPN joins to talk about the manipulation of the officiating by the Rockets.

The Rockets need to stop focusing on the refs and focus on their game.

I spoke to a referee earlier this season that told me in some instances, they wouldn't mind if some NBA players were BANNED for a few games.

Y‚Äôall have to see this @30for30 documentary on Felipe Lopez. Don‚Äôt miss this y‚Äôall!

All eyes will be on James Harden and the Rockets tonight.

I have PROFOUND respect for the Rockets. But STOP complaining about the REFS and focus on BALLING out there!

RT @FirstTake : While @stephenasmith had some things to get off his chest, @maxkellerman had to remind him and @IsiahThomas that this is a family show. üòÇ

My picks are in and I'm fully prepared for your disagreement üòÄ

Yes, right now I think Kevin Durant is the best player on the PLANET!

Congrats to the @sixers. Way to represent @JimmyButler. Bigtime game. Major heart! But Embiid is clearly hurt. Aside from that, Green and Ibaka....combining for 5 points. 5-Damn-points. Inexcusable. But hey, the @sixers may give us a series after all.

Coming up on my radio show, I'll discuss what the Celtics and Warriors wins mean in the big picture.

Okay. Before anybody gets beside themselves, let‚Äôs not talk like @CP3 deserves a suspension. That was incidental contact towards the official in the spur of the moment. It was not an attempt at intimidation. Let who wins this series do it fair & square please.

If the allegations are true we won't see Tyreek Hill on a field for a long time.

Chris Canty joins to provide an ex-players perspective.

I'm trying to figure out what the Giants were thinking when they took Daniel Jones with the six pick.

See, I‚Äôm a man of the people üòâ

All I know is this: Haskins has better not fall past the @Dolphins or @Redskins in this draft. It better not happen. Now with the need those two teams have for a QB-of-the-future

However, don‚Äôt even get me started on these damn @Giants. Passing on Haskins for Daniel Jones? Some kid out of Duke usurps a cat who threw 50 TD‚Äôs primarily vs. Big Ten competition? Why? Because the Mannings love him? You have got to be kidding me.

YEEEAAAHHHH!!!! I love that the @steelers moved up to get this brother Devin Bush. What have they been missing since @RyanShazier went down? A playmaking LB. I love, love, love this. Yes!#GoSteelers

Come join us on @FirstTake, @KingJames!!!!

Sixth Man of the Year is a ONE man race as far as I‚Äôm concerned!!! It‚Äôs Lou Williams!

I‚Äôll join in. 5 jobs I‚Äôve had:

I'm very OBJECTIVE, DAMNIT! But when it comes to Derek Jeter and superstars that come to the Knicks, all BETS are off! üòÄüòÄüòÄ

Damian Lillard's shot is one of the most MEMORABLE game-winning shots I've EVER seen!

OMG! OMG! OMG! @Dame_Lillard drills a 3 damn-near from hakfciurt to win the game.....and the series. He dropped 50 pts on the night. What a performance. Just spectacular!

OMG! Do y‚Äôall see this show @Dame_Lillard is putting on IN THE FIRST HALF! Absolutely Spectacular! He‚Äôs got 34 points at HALFTIME! Putting on a damn show. Lord Have Mercy, this is unreal!

PJ Carlesimo joins the show to talk about tonight's Thunder/Blazers game he's calling.

üìªAfter Dark podcast: @IsiahThomas joins the show to go in-depth on what he sees in these NBA Playoffs.

Odell Beckham Jr. had every right to respond to Dave Gettleman's comments.

Pascal Siakam is EASILY the Most Improved Player, in my opinion!

If I was Kevin Durant, I'd be PISSED half the time, TOO!

The matchup is set, Kyrie vs the Greek Freak. Which side are you going with?

I think KYRIE is more important to his team than GIANNIS for THESE playoffs!

I talk to Mark Jackson about the NBA Playoffs, the changing landscape of the NBA going into the 2019 season, and his coaching future.

This weekend's NBA playoff games and drama between players and media.

So now @blakegriffin23 fouled out. Good! Nothing else to prove. Phenomenal effort on his part. Love that @DetroitPistons fans gave him a standing ovation. He deserved it.

Okay Coach Casey, this is enough. Get @blakegriffin23 the hell out of this game. On one leg, he‚Äôs done everything he could do. Incredibly effort. But he can‚Äôt be asked to give anymore. Enough!

Mark Jackson joins the show to discuss the Warriors & Rockets possible 2nd round matchup.

- NBA Playoffs

Trainer Virgil Hunter just told a Nat‚Äôl Audience he ASKED @amirkingkhan if he wanted to continue and Khan said ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù its official. I AM DONE with @amirkingkhan. Don‚Äôt even want to see him fight anymore. He wanted Hunter to rescue him from an imminent Knockout. I‚Äôm totally Done!

Man, give me a damn break. I‚Äôm sorry, but that did not look like @amirkingkhan got hit in the private‚Äôs. And HE didn‚Äôt quit, his trainer did. This is some straight B.S. Feel bad for @terencecrawford. His time was WASTED. Goodbye Khan. What a damn shame!

Now THAT‚Äôs Bull$&@$! Go ahead and give flagrants to both @JoelEmbiid and @JaredDudley619. Although I hate how soft these rules are, the rules are what they are. But there‚Äôs no way @JimmyButler should‚Äôve been ejected. These are the @NBA Playoffs, damnit! No fists were thrown.#Damn

I have a lot of faith in Kyrie Irving as well as the Houston Rockets, but predict very different outcomes for each.

The exceptional performance of Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Giannis.

Rudy Gobert is my vote for Defensive Player of the Year!

The man, @JoelEmbiid is out for tonight‚Äôs game. So there‚Äôs no excuse for @BrooklynNets to lose this game.

RT @espn : "DOMINATE!"

A real throwback of me interviewing @SHAQ! #TBT

I think we need to be CAREFUL about being critical on Kevin Durant about THIS.

Kevin Durant, we're waiting!

Luka Doncic is the Rookie of the Year. PERIOD.

The biggest problems in this year's NBA Playoffs.

I don't want to HEAR it. Dak Prescott SHOULD be making at least $25M a year, DAMNIT!

Kevin Durant is getting embarrassed by Patrick Beverley, but can he turn things around?

James Harden has my vote for LEAGUE MVP! This man is carrying the ROCKETS on his BACK!

What did last night tell us about KD? üì∫ #ESPNews üìª #ESPNRadio

Yes I'm still talking about TIGER.

And if ever there was an athlete who personified perseverance, about overcoming trials and tribulations, it is @TigerWoods today. I never thought he‚Äôd win a major again. Now I think he‚Äôs gonna surpass him. HE‚Äôs the shark in blood-infected waters. Everyone else is the prey!#UhOh

What amazes me about this @TigerWoods victory wasn‚Äôt his patience and poise in avoiding the mistakes on 12 that Molinari and others made. It‚Äôs that I thought he was emotionally finished. Too much time spent on what others thought, plus the injuries. But he did it. So amazing.

Yyyyteeeeahhhh! @TigerWoods. I can‚Äôt believe it. I can‚Äôt believe he did it. Never thought I see this day again. Congratulations! Golf is officially back

Holy S$&$! @TigerWoods is in the lead. He‚Äôs about the win this thing! Come on, Tiger. Because I‚Äôll be damned if I ever thought he‚Äôd be in this position again.

What a shot just now by @TigerWoods . What a shot. Now we find out what guys are made of with @TigerWoods nipping at their heels.

Yeah! Yeah! Here comes @TigerWoods

Really Amir Johnson? You‚Äôre suppose to be an Ole‚Äô Head on this @sixers squad, and you showing text messages to @JoelEmbiid? Let alone in the 4th QT when you‚Äôre down 14? Come on bro! You know better than that.#Damn!

He deserves it.

Love what I‚Äôm hearing: that Luke Walton is about to get the @SacramentoKings job. Phenomenal hire if he and @bgoodvlade can reach an agreement. Everyone in BBall knows Luke was dealt an unfair hand. To get a job is good enough, to land THAT job is something special.#LoveIt

#UFC236  Do I really need to say anymore? Y‚Äôall know what time it is. Tune in, damnit :-)

@B_LEAGUE @ALVARK_TOKYO Wow!!!!

I‚Äôve always loved this brother. But one of my living nightmares was when I agreed to let him dress me for a magazine article. All I remember is how petrified I was that he‚Äôd have me looking like this:

Buckle up, AMERICA. Here I come. @FirstTake at the top of the hour. That means you @Lakers. You @MagicJohnson. You @JeanieBuss. Go ahead @LakersNation, buy all this B.S. if you want. I‚Äôll see y‚Äôall in a few minutes.

RT @ARBernard : There is a difference between gossip and giving information, and it is distinguished by motivation. Your motivation should be pure when you share information. #ARBWisdom #motivation

I don‚Äôt know what the HELL just happened with MAGIC JOHNSON!!!!!!

OMG! @MagicJohnson has stepped down. As if things weren‚Äôt bad enough for the @Lakers. This is UNREAL. Not a good look for him, for Jeanie Buss, for @KingJames. Nobody. Good Lord Have mercy!

No one said he‚Äôs talking to the @Lakers NOW. I said he‚Äôll be talking to a few teams this Summer.

I‚Äôm nervous as hell hosting this special edition of @SportsCenter right now on ESPN. You never get use to this, at least if you‚Äôre ME. Pray for me :-)

RT @ESPNLosAngeles : üîäSOUND ON!

You only needed 2-pts, Culver. No need for the 3-pointer there at all.

Yeeeaaahhhh! Didn‚Äôt see this coming. But now we have ourselves a game. Great pass from Culver gets converted into an And-1. @TexasTechMBB pulls within 59-58 of @UVAMensHoops with 3:28 left. Yes!!!!!

It‚Äôs 53-43 @UVAMensHoops with over 9 minutes left and I still feel this game is damn-near over. VA won‚Äôt miss for the first time this tournament and @TexasTechMBB can‚Äôt seem to get anything going! Hey, at least one of them scored over 50 pts.

Zion Williamson proves that some college athletes should be paid more than others.

Last night's clash in Philly was a good one but did it win Giannis the MVP?

No! It wasn‚Äôt ME on the court last night!

I said this years ago. It still applies, and forever will:

Even with a baggy suit, ya boy still gets buckets üòâüòâüòâ #TBT

Bryce Harper is better off in Philly.

Y'all know that KD ejection was BOGUS.

You see, that‚Äôs that B.S. right there. @KDTrey5 just gets ejected. The ejection was entirely too quick. @boogiecousins restrained him. Kerr intervenes...AND STILL the dam ref ejected him. The @NBA has got to put a stop to this. Folks pay to see these guys not the refs.#Ridiculous

The lifetime contract given to John Calipari by Kentucky.

Breaking down what's going on with the short-lived AAF.

I love Odell Beckham Jr.'s game but feel like he still has a lot to prove.

John Mara wasn't being completely honest with the fans about why Eli is still the starter.

RT @ESPNLosAngeles : The Lakers reportedly feel another coach - not Jason Kidd - will receive "strong consideration" as a potential replacement (via @stephenasmith)

I want @KingJames to hear THIS one!

Let's revisit Duke surviving, more Lakers drama and my thoughts on Gronk's place among the TE greats.

But what a game! What a game!

OM! @DukeMBB is in trouble. And I‚Äôll tell you why: B/c Tre Jones can‚Äôt make shots, @UCF_MBB does not have to guard him and it‚Äôs helping them to let on Barrett and Reddish. Coach K should‚Äôve pulled him.

I‚Äôm sitting here watching this @DukeMBB vs @UCF_MBB and two are jumping out at me: Coach K needs to bench Tre Jones b/c he just cannot shoot. AND....this kid Aubrey Dawkins is showing out...yes....better than RJ Barrett.

Jesus! Now this is getting damn ridiculous. I don‚Äôt even know if there‚Äôs a race for League MVP anymore. This man is just UNREAL. I‚Äôm starting to fear the beard so much, I might advise the Warriors to fear him too.

All these people chirping about LEBRON being UNCOACHABLE need to RELAX.

This is what I think.

You know what time it is. I'm talking MARCH MADNESS, @KingJames visiting MSG and much more on today's radio show.  Let‚Äôs go!

It‚Äôs about that time. The NCAA. @KingJames getting screwed over. @russwest44 screwing himself over. The list goes on and on. @FirstTake in the house right now. Let‚Äôs get it!

Now this is getting ridiculous. I won‚Äôt hesitate to criticize @KingJames when warranted, but this is too much and entirely unfair. He was talking to other teammates. Plus, how can we accuse him of NOT CARING. Damn y‚Äôall. Folks are going too far. Not fair. He doesn‚Äôt deserve that!

LeBron's influence has gotten to a point where owners and execs are getting ANNOYED!

Also, @RealJayWilliams is on ESPN now making a fantastic pt: It was beautiful watching those @Vol_Hoops players giving thanks to the Lord after the game...while also playing with an edge, with grit, during the game. These boys can play. They can shoot. And They trust one another.

What a Game b/t @Vol_Hoops & @KentuckyMBB. That kid Williams balled; demanded the ball when it mattered most. Plus three bigtime 3‚Äôs in the last two min of the game after they hadn‚Äôt made one the entire 2nd Half. Special performance. Real special. Could make run in the dance.

After Dark podcast: I can't deny LeBron his greatness, but I'll tell you what you CAN deny him.

LeBron on the move?

All that matters to CLEVELAND right now is one season. Pray he makes it through 2019 and then go from there

Because you‚Äôre obviously high and don‚Äôt know what the hell youre talking about. And clearly you haven‚Äôt heard me over the years talking on a multitude of subjects

Was Eli Manning the real reason Odell Beckham Jr. got traded?

@TwitterVideo

Right now, Kyler Murray should be considered the best in the draft.

Thank you. üôèüèæ

Now that Odell Beckham Jr. is in Cleveland, I'm not sure the Browns will win the AFC North.

Russell Westbrook got into a verbal altercation with another Jazz fan.

Should Russell Westbrook be punished by the NBA? I'll talk about it next on the Stephen A. Smith radio show.

Why didn‚Äôt the Steelers get more in return for Antonio Brown?

This Antonio Brown trade was RIDICULOUS!

Current Mood. I‚Äôm pissed. Period

I'm pissed off at the Steelers. I'll tell you why! TUNE IN!!!

The Lakers NEED to find a big-time player to play with LEBRON. If they don‚Äôt, they are in TROUBLE!!

I am absolutely, positively disgusted with the @Steelers! You trying to tell me all they could get for ANTONIO Brown was a freakin 3rd and 5th round  pick? That‚Äôs it! Not even a 2nd-round pick for a WR this elite? Oh, come on! This is total BS. I‚Äôm so disgusted right now.

Snoop Dogg calls in to share his views on the David Irving video and weed use in the NFL.

It seems like the Steelers can't get anything of value for Antonio Brown and I blame him for that.

My man Snoop called into the show and kept it real.

You need to hear this from me loud and clear (part 2)

You need to hear this from me loud and clear (part 1)

I agree with you bro. But until they do what they‚Äôre suppose to do, rules are rules and players should follow them.

Chris Haynes of @YahooSports joins the show to talk about LeBron, the Lakers and Kevin Durant's future.

No one can deny LeBron's greatness as he passed MJ for fourth on all-time scoring list. After Dark podcast:

Some outtakes for y'all üòâ

Even on LeBron‚Äôs big night, things got ugly at Staples. üì∫ #ESPNews üéô #ESPNRadio

This comparison is probably fitting: Sidney Moncrief ‚Äî who the @Lakers entertainer taking in 1979 instead of Magic ‚Äî was pretty damn solid. But he wasn‚Äôt @MagicJohnson. He wasn‚Äôt box office. Nor was he ever the best or most dominant.

Good point, BT, although I could throw Moses Malone in there, too. But here‚Äôs the problem: although Elvin avg 21 and 12 for his career ‚Äî avg at least 25ppg his first 4 years ‚Äî he was never considered the best nor most dominant. Plus, he wasn‚Äôt box office. That could be the reason

The Lakers are a major disappointment.

The challenges that have turned this Lakers season into a disaster.

Charley Casserly, what are you talking about?

The 1st QT is over. @Lakers down 43-25.....on the verge of getting blown out of the Staples Center on a night @KingJames will surpass Jordan on the all-time scoring list. Although LBJ has hit 2 3‚Äôs, at one pt he missed 4-straight FT‚Äôs. Everyone‚Äôs getting booed. Could get ugly!

Why weren't any of these concerns about Kyler Murray ever echoed during the season?

I'm upset that people are bashing Kyler Murray's intelligence and leadership.

Just saw a video from @Jeopardy Host Alex Trebek....announcing he has Pancreatic Cancer. @Jeopardy was my Momma‚Äôs favorite show ever. Saddened right now. Just wanted to extend my thoughts and prayers to Trebek, wishing him all the best.#DontEverGiveUp!

What a damn MESS!

Time to bury the Lakers!!!

RT @ESPNPR : Stephen A. from LA!

After Dark podcast: @SHAQ tries to prank call me again.

Gotta say this about @KingJames tonight: he is playing D. More importantly, he‚Äôs gift-wrapping open shots to his teammates. They just can‚Äôt make anything. It‚Äôs 4:05 left and the @Lakers are down 107-94. Looks like it‚Äôs over. The game....and their season! But who knows.

With 6:04 left in regulation, @kylekuzma goes down hard. Hurts his leg. Has to go to locker room. May not return.

The @Lakers were flowing smoothly until @MONSTATREZZ entered the game and proceeded to completely abuse/bully McGee. Luke Walton called a timeout to stop the abuse. @KingJames just rolled his eyes, and I don‚Äôt blame him one bit.

After Dark podcast: I call out inaccuracies in Jeanie Buss' comments about the Lakers organization.

After Dark podcast: While it looks more and more likely the Lakers will miss the playoffs, Jeanie Buss blamed the media for her team's chemistry issues.

RT @PabloTorre : Today's @HIGHNOONonESPN cold open, feat. @stephenasmith:

OMG, how do you lose to the SUNS!?!?!?!!? #ESPNews #ESPNRadio

If @KingJames doesn't make the playoffs, YES, it matters for his legacy.

The @celtics are getting destroyed. How in earth do you go into the half already having surrendered 5 3‚Äôs to Eric Gordon, be down 22 because of it, then open the 2nd half giving up 2 wide-open 3‚Äôs? Horrible defense by the @celtics and scary explosiveness from the @HoustonRockets

The @Lakers lost to the damn @Suns tonight. You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. And now....sources tell me @KingJames got on the first bus out of the arena ‚Äî which might be the first time he‚Äôs ever done that in his career. What a disaster. But I‚Äôm holding on. Season ends w/ loss Monday.

Sorry, Randy Gregory. I wish you nothing but the best. Seriously! But I couldn‚Äôt resist sending this message to Cowboys‚Äô Fans everywhere!

Have we REALLY gotten to this point when it comes to LeBron?

Rather than worry about Mr.Kraft, why don‚Äôt you try worrying about dudes blowing the opportunities of a lifetime because they can‚Äôt stop puffing and passing? It may not be illegal, but it is prohibited by your employer. Do brothers want to get paid or not? That‚Äôs the question.

Kyrie. LeBron. Kaepernick. Tune in. #ESPNews #ESPNRadio

My man, with all due respect it‚Äôs not bashing. Mr. Kraft has to deal with a LEGAL issue, which involves far more sensitivity. In the case of the cats you‚Äôre talking about, we‚Äôre discussing dudes ‚Äî who ain‚Äôt worth billions ‚Äî blowing MILLIONS because they can‚Äôt stay off the Weed!

I think this one is pretty clear now.

The Lakers STINK! They are contaminating Hollywood, DAMNIT!

To my surprise the Lakers actually came back to win last night. #ESPNews #ESPNRadio

Should Zion Williamson stay at Duke or walk out on his team?

Wow! @JHarden13 fouls out....getting called for offensive foul. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time he‚Äôs fouled out. Evidently, the refs watched our segment on @FirstTake where I talked about opponents complaining about him getting too many calls. Sorry! I want him IN THE GAME!

Uh oh! @JHarden13 picks up 5th personal with 2:47 left. Could hamper him and the @HoustonRockets offensively the rest of the way, unless @CP3 or someone else steps up. We‚Äôll see.

Oh Snap. I stand corrected. The @Lakers have roared back to within 92-91. 8:11 left in the 4th. We have ourselves a game

Hanging here at the Staples Center and it‚Äôs just so obvious that the @Lakers have no shot to win this game. Struggles shooting, etc., ain‚Äôt even the biggest culprit. They simply cannot stop @JHarden13. He‚Äôs just too good for them. Here‚Äôs hoping they at least make it interesting.

After Zion Williamson got hurt thirty six seconds into the UNC game, most people think he should shut it down but I feel we shouldn't be telling kids to quit on their team.

I know I Will be there. Thank God this Flu bug has left me. Now I can finally get back to work.#Rested&Ready.

What a comeback by @DukeMBB. They brought it in the last 10 minutes if this game. Zion is the truth as a competitor, and Reddish is underrated. But damn, @LouisvilleMBB just broke down. Complete and utter panic by their guards, plain and simple.

OMG! Sitting home sick, but watching @DukeMBB‚Äôs 23-point COMEBACK on @LouisvilleMBB. While I can applaud the way L‚ÄôVille played until late, what a complete meltdown. Every single one of their guards wanted NO PARTS of ballhandling responsibilities. And oh, Cam Reddish can SHOOT!

@AB84 Yo @steelers DO NOT LISTEN to this. I hear @AB84. I hear his frustration. But he is TOO GREAT to let go over this. Y‚Äôall are grown men. Work it out. Find a way. Because you don‚Äôt just replace AB. Damnit, y‚Äôall got me riled up on my sick day. I‚Äôm suppose to be resting.#Damn!

Damn, people! @russwest44 a 10th-straight Triple-Double. Him & @Yg_Trece becoming 1st in NBA History with 20+pt triple-doubles. And PG with 47pts. I mean....Damn! This dynamic duo is becoming THE STORY of the NBA. And way to go PG for sharing that love with Russ.#ThisUsSpecial2C

After Dark Podcast: What's next for the Lakers this summer?

Man, this man JJ Redick is on it. One of the game‚Äôs prolific shooters. His shooting strike is something special.

Yes. It's possible.

Haaaaa! Now that‚Äôs a good comeback. But we shall see. Haskins wants to throw. I know this. Also know he‚Äôs nowhere near the athlete J.T.Barrett was. But I‚Äôve got to see him be that pocket passer that everyone swears he is on the NFL. That‚Äôs just ME. We shall see.

Haskins is bigtime. I know this. And I‚Äôm not saying he CAN‚ÄôT pass. But I view him the way I view him. Just an eye-test thing. Im not talking statistically. Make of it what you will.

Why? Because I believe what I believe? I know Haskins is a baller. That he threw for 50 TD‚Äôs last year. But I view his athleticism as more of a plus (I.e. scrambling outside the pocket, etc.) I don‚Äôt view him as an ideal pocket passer, nor the runner than Kyler is. Period!

Wow! Way da go @RajonRondo. Wow! Happy for this brother. Reminded us he‚Äôs a champion. What a game. What a performance by the @Lakers . 22 3-pointers on the night. Love it!

Yes! I‚Äôm loving this @Lakers vs @celtics game. @KingJames just hit a 3 from the left corner. Scored tied 124-124. He looks sluggish and still has a triple-double, 3 treys in the 4QT and five 3‚Äôs overall. LakeShow continues to play like this and they‚Äôll be fine.

I was told ‚Äî eventually ‚Äî Pelicans GM Dell Demps would have been FIRED had he made the Anthony Davis trade!

My thoughts on the Markelle Fultz trade.

Lots to discuss leading up to the NBA trade deadline. #ESPNews #ESPNRadio

I don't have a problem with what Kevin Durant said.

Could LeBron regret it in the end?? It's possible..

Stephen A. Smith After Dark Podcast ‚û°Ô∏èI'm disappointed with the Rams fanbase turnout.

Stephen A. Smith After Dark Podcast ‚û°Ô∏èWhile Julian Edelman was brilliant, I feel the MVP award should have gone to a NE defender.

Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhh Haaaaaaaaa!!!!! Where ya been bro??? Missed ya! @theshiggster

While the fellas were getting heated today, here's what I was doing ü§£ü§£ü§£

MJ or Brady????

Lots to unwrap from that Super Bowl game. #ESPNews #ESPNRadio

It‚Äôs Brady time. If the @Patriots don‚Äôt score this drive they are in trouble.

The two MVP‚Äôs of this game so far: Wade Phillips and Brian Flores, defensive play callers for both teams. Doing their damn jobs.......too well for my liking :-)

Awwww Damn! Patrick Chung is down. Moss instantly saw it and says hyperextended elbow. He‚Äôs done.

This is when you know you‚Äôve arrived: when you‚Äôre honored with the luxury of watching the Super Bowl with two Hall of Famers.

Props to the human being who had a 3-0 score at halftime. Because I damn sure didn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt think anyone saw this coming

It‚Äôs the two-minute warning. The @RamsNFL have 25 yards rushing and 2 ‚Äî yes, 2 ‚Äî First Downs!#Damn!

I‚Äôm shocked at how ineffective @TG3II has been the last 5 1/2 QT‚Äôs. But I‚Äôm even more shocked at how dominant @Patriots defense has been this far. Boy-genius Sean McVay and this offense hasn‚Äôt been able to do a damn thing yet.

The @Patriots are killing the @RamsNFL are these crossing routes with Edelman and Gronk. But we‚Äôll see how long that lasts

Another 3-and-out by the @RamsNFL to start the 2nd Qt. Goff seems flustered by @Patriots defense. A 3rd-year QB vs Belichick.

Wow! A coverage sack by the @RamsNFL, followed by more and more pressure, including Aaron Donald getting a hit on Brady. This game is scoreless after the 1st QT. I don‚Äôt think anyone expected THIS.

Or was it Littleton? I‚Äôm in Nose-Bleed section üòÄüòÄüòÄ

That penalty may have been vs Robey-Coleman, but let‚Äôs be clear: he is everywhere thus far. He looks like he‚Äôs come to play

Robey-Coleman on the deflection. Fowler pick. After the @Patriots ran ball down their throats, Brady gets intercepted on first pass. Hmmmmmm!!!!!

Super Bowl hasn‚Äôt started yet, but I will say this: @RamsNFL fans should be ashamed of yourselves. @Patriots fans are in the house, outnumbering them at least 15-to-1. Certainly sounds like that in this stadium. Props to Massachusetts! LA? What is up with y‚Äôall?

The After Dark podcast üéô: I talk to @Realrclark25 about how Louisianans feel about Anthony Davis, Sal Pal previews the Super Bowl, and the @BronzeBomber joins to discuss his previous bout with Fury.

Latest After Dark podcast: @SHAQ joins the show to talk about the NBA's changing culture.

RT @michaeleaves : Just got off the phone with Frank Robinson. You may have heard that he's been a little sick lately, but he was definitely in good spirits when I spoke to him this evening. And, as usual, his biting humor was in Hall of Fame form.

Nobody was like my man @DeionSanders.

Tom Brady is my vote for best Super Bowl player ever.

Holllaaaa atttt yaaaa Boyyyy!!!
